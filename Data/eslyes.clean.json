The government continues to pursue and arrest millions of marijuana and cocaine users every year. The government says that marijuana and cocaine are so dangerous and addictive that they must remain illegal. However, it has long legalized alcohol and tobacco, two products which kill hundreds of thousands of Americans annually. Meanwhile, because millions of Americans continue to use marijuana and cocaine daily, their purchases are making drug dealers filthy rich.\nHow rich are they? Local police recently stumbled upon two privately owned submarines, containing 500 pounds of cocaine, in a harbor in Colombia. Colombia supplies 90 percent of America's cocaine. The submarines can carry five tons of drugs to Mexico, where the cargo travels by truck into the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) officials believe that the Colombian drug lords possess about 20 of these 55‐foot subs. However, they are confident they will find all of them.\nReportedly, drug lords have also purchased a Russian cannon that can fire a 2‐ton shell 500 miles. The cannon, now hidden in Mexico, will be used to fire 2‐ton packages of cocaine, marijuana, and other drugs into southeast New Mexico, where drug lords have secretly bought thousands of acres of desert land. The packages will land in the desert, undetected by U.S. radar. Once they land safely among the cactuses and scorpions, the packages will be stored underground. The drug lords are building a huge complex of tunnels and storage space under the New Mexico desert. The tunnels will connect to truck routes for transporting drugs to major cities. A DEA official said that even if the cannon and tunnels exist, it just proves that DEA is winning the war on drugs.",

But to this day, and probably far into the future, many people dispute this \"lone gunman\" theory. They believe JFK's death was a result of a conspiracy by one or more groups of people who felt threatened or deserted by JFK.

        "grade": 9.7,
        "text": "Hemp is a strong, cane‐like plant known throughout the world for its durability and versatility. Hemp is used to make ropes, blankets, paper, and many other useful products. In the United States, however, the hemp industry and its supporters struggle for legitimacy. The U.S. government is concerned that hemp producers might grow hemp to sell as marijuana. Hemp, although a variety of the cannabis species, contains less than one percent of THC, which is the active ingredient of marijuana. To get high from hemp, a person would have to smoke about ten hemp cigarettes.\nAs a result of its concern, the U.S. government discourages the production and use of hemp and its products in America. Instead, it approves the destruction of millions of trees annually to produce newspapers and hundreds of other paper products that get thrown away every day. All those paper products can be made from hemp.\nHemp was discovered in Asia thousands of years ago. It is cultivated worldwide. Hemp can grow quickly to heights of 15 feet or more in many different climates and soils. It needs little care to achieve its full growth.\nHemp matures in one growing season. It's used in many products, from paper to beauty products to clothing. Like bamboo, it is used in the construction industry. Hemp is healthful, too—its seeds produce a nutritious flour and oil.\nDespite all hemp's beneficial—and non‐drug—uses, the U.S. government continues to argue that the use of hemp might lead to increased use of marijuana. Marijuana, says the government, is the gateway drug to more dangerous drugs like cocaine and heroin. Apparently, the government believes that hemp could be the gateway drug (ten cigarettes to get high) to the gateway drug marijuana (one \"joint,\" or often less, to get high).\nWhile focused on the individual dangers and societal decay that might  result from ten hemp cigarettes, the U.S. government does little to prevent the thousands of deaths, injuries, and illnesses caused annually by tobacco and alcohol—two of the most addictive, dangerous, popular (and profitable)—drugs in the world. In fact, the government also does nothing to discourage gambling, as most states now have state lotteries, and many states have gambling casinos. All three industries contribute to the government's bottom line.\nPerhaps hemp producers could win government support if they just focused on demonstrating how much money that hemp production, products, and sales could contribute to government coffers."

        "text": "According to the 2000 U.S. Census, 39 percent of people who live in California do not speak English at home. In Las Casas, a city in southern California, 79 percent of residents speak little or no English at home or at work. To combat this problem, Las Casas is instituting a program called \"Love My English.\" Program funding will come from government grants and corporate donations.\nThe program has two goals. One is to improve residents' English so that they can get better jobs. The other is to provide more qualified workers for corporations throughout the county.\n\"We are desperate for good workers who speak English,\" said Sydney Rove of Containers, Ltd. \"We have nationwide truck routes for good drivers, and we need salespeople in almost every state.\"\n\"We want everyone in Las Casas to speak English,\" said Ivan Libby, administrator of the school district. \"They don't have to speak fluent English, of course, just survival English—how to give and get directions, order food, visit the doctor, read labels on food and medicines—the basic stuff. Once they're able to read and write more English, they'll be able to get better work and they'll be more confident. We hope this confidence will inspire some of them to go on to get their high school diploma and perhaps even get a degree from a community college or a university.\"\nCurrently, most Las Casas residents qualify for only low‐paying jobs. In fact, the pay is often so low that residents need to work two jobs to make ends meet. This program will help them get better‐paying jobs not only in California but also nationwide. The district will mount a huge advertising campaign to alert residents to the free program. \"Love My English\" will be offered at various sites and times to reach as many residents as possible."

        "grade": 9.3,
        "text": "Influenza, or the flu, attacks up to one billion people annually. In the U.S., it kills 20,000 annually, most of whom are children or elderly. Occasionally the flu becomes pandemic: in 1918, it killed 20 million people worldwide. The flu is a very contagious viral infection spread through the air by coughing, sneezing, or simply talking. It is not caused by getting caught in a rainstorm or by sleeping with the fan or air‐conditioning on.\nThe incubation period is about three days. It doesn't sneak up on you, like a cold does. All of a sudden, you feel weak, you have a high fever, you have chills, you cough frequently and forcefully, your throat is sore, and your body aches.\nFor most adults, the treatment is to simply wait it out: stay home, get lots of bed rest, drink lots of fluids, and take over‐the‐counter medications such as aspirin, pain‐killers, and nasal decongestants. Symptoms usually go away within two weeks. For the elderly and young, the initial viral infection may become a bacterial infection with deadly consequences, because the victim becomes too weak to battle the disease. The death rate for the general population is about one in 1,000. Those most susceptible to severe effects of the flu are people over 65 and people with chronic heart or lung problems, such as asthma.\nFlu season in the U.S. is usually December to March. The best prevention, of course, is to stay away from infected people. Since that is almost impossible, the next best preventive strategy is to get an annual flu shot. This vaccine reduces the number of people who get infected and who die yearly.",

Because of rumors that workers were mistreating animals, a member of the Humane Society managed to visit the slaughterhouse one day. With his video camera, he secretly filmed a worker prodding a lame cow with an electric shock stick, a worker pushing a sick cow with the metal bars of a forklift, and a worker shooting water from a hose into the nostrils of a sick cow. He filmed a forklift operator lifting and transporting dead cows onto the \"kill floor.\" The video made national TV news. The workers told federal investigators that they were only following orders.\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture requires humane treatment of sick and lame cows. It allows the slaughter of healthy cows only. Meatland Packing Company is a major beef supplier to U.S. school systems and fast food outlets. USDA demanded a recall of all Meatland beef—143 million pounds, the largest amount of beef ever recalled in the U.S. \"Unfortunately,\" said a health official, \"the USDA became aware of the problem too late.\" Almost all of the beef had been consumed before the recall was announced.\n\"Consumers got lucky this time,\" the official said. \"We haven't had one report of illness. Next time consumers won't be so lucky. And there will be a next time, because USDA inspects only five percent of the nation's meat supply.\"\nA federal prosecutor has charged two Meatland supervisors with felony animal cruelty. Both men could spend six years in prison if convicted. The Humane Society asked the public to donate more money to help it prevent more cruelty to animals.",

Five weeks ago, Dr. Marina had injected Lidocaine into the same place in order to get a biopsy. She had cut out a section of a puffy, white circle with a nearly dime‐size diameter. The subsequent lab report indicated basal cell carcinoma. Five years ago and two years ago, two different dermatologists had told Brad that the puffy circle was just a \"fat deposit.\" Brad was worried. He'd read that such cancer was rarely fatal but often disfiguring. Had the cancer had time to grow into his cheekbone? Dr. Marina had said the \"Mohs\" surgery might last all day. Operating on several patients today, Dr. Eduard would cut, examine each specimen microscopically, and cut again until he'd removed all the cancerous tissue from each patient."

One official has already suggested a proposal. He thinks that a fine might work. If the city has to respond to complaints, the homeowner will be charged $200 per response. Such a fine might cause the homeowner to be careful to rent only to people that he is sure will be considerate of the neighbors. The city would still get 15 percent of the rental fee, even if the homeowner's rent were totally offset by fines. The city would post inconsiderate renters' names on the city website so that other homeowners would know about them.\nSome officials think the ban should be continued because these visitors to the community have already proven that they have no consideration for others.

        "text": "For the last two years, the Los Angeles area has seen an increasing number of metal thefts, reported Paul Moyer, co‐anchor of the local 6 o'clock news. Sometime before dawn Wednesday, thieves had stolen the copper wire out of six lamp posts. A day earlier, a heavy, 7‐foot‐tall, bronze statue of a gold miner in West LA had disappeared. Eight manhole covers in downtown LA had been removed three nights earlier. At least twice a week, Moyer reported, thieves steal copper from construction sites. All this metal is sold as scrap.\nThe price of copper today is six times what it was just six years ago. Even the federal government is reducing production of pennies, because it now takes two cents' worth of copper to produce a one‐cent penny. LA's police chief, Bill Bratton, promised that he was going to increase the number of cameras and live patrols around statues and all outdoor metal sculptures in LA. He said that metal thieves were destroying LA's \"cultural history.\" He reminded thieves that they were endangering their own lives when they cut into live wires, and they were endangering drivers' lives when they removed manhole covers.\nMoyer, famous for his wit, ended his special report by joking that it was a good thing that the Statue of Liberty was not in Los Angeles harbor. \"I bet that would be worth a pretty penny,\" chuckled his blonde co-anchor.",

If it hits a populated area, the number of deaths will greatly exceed the 1,070 deaths caused by Hurricane Katrina in Louisiana.\nThree California quakes between 1987 and 1994 killed more than 100 people and caused billions of dollars in damage. From 1994 to 2000, the state spent several billion dollars reinforcing bridges, overpasses, and buildings. But budget problems have halted these repairs. Today, more than 1,000 schools and hospitals—not to mention thousands of other government and private structures—throughout the state do not meet earthquake standards. Many of these buildings will collapse like a house of cards if they are in the immediate area of a quake.\nAs usual, the state is between a rock and a hard place. If schools use their budgets to reinforce their buildings, they will have little money for teachers. Classes will be discontinued. Everyone's priority, of course, is to keep the schools open.\n\"All we're doing is crossing our fingers,\" said a state legislator. \"But that's exactly what they did in Louisiana. They could have fixed the levee system for about $10 billion. But they didn't; they just crossed their fingers. Now it's now going to cost $100 billion to rebuild New Orleans. Here in California, we're saying that we can't afford the $10 billion. But where are we going to get the $100 billion to rebuild everything afterward? People never learn. They always close the barn door after the horse escapes.\" 8.6, 256"

To register (or reregister) to vote, Arizona residents must now show a birth certificate or passport. Reregistration is required whenever a resident changes addresses. This requirement will cause problems for citizens who have lost their birth certificate or who don't have a passport.\n\"These problems will be settled in time,\" said Barney Fife, an election official. \"Our priority is to prevent noncitizens from voting. Over 3,000 immigrants voted—illegally—in the last governor's election. Voting is a vital right that belongs to citizens exclusively, not to every Tom, Dick, and Harry that has just immigrated to this country.\"\nCritics of the new law say that it will disenfranchise thousands of legitimate voters. Mrs. Thelma May agrees. She just moved to Tucson from Phoenix. She has to reregister now in order to vote, but has no birth certificate or passport.\n\"I've been voting all my life,\" she said. \"I voted for JFK in '60. But I'm on my third marriage—I do hope it's my last—which means that my last name has changed three times. The Biloxi hospital I was born in was destroyed by hurricane Camille in 1969. All its records—including my birth certificate—ended up in the Gulf. My only copy of my birth certificate was lost when my drunken first husband fell asleep on the sofa smoking a cigarette. The entire house burnt down. I've lived in Arizona for the past 25 years. I've never even set foot outside America, and now I've got to prove that I'm a citizen of the United States?!\" 8.6, 283"

        "text": "Researchers are discovering more and more about the inner workings of the brain through MRI and PET scans. Both scans produce images of active, inactive, healthy, and unhealthy areas of the brain.\nThese images are helping doctors treat brain dysfunction. In the United States, drugs have been the most common treatment for people with brain dysfunction. While even better drugs continue to be developed, drug‐free remedies are now thought to be possible because of new research with DNA and stem cells.\nBut some scientists think that even these remedies might be unnecessary. They think that many people with brain dysfunction can fix themselves by simply \"training\" their brains. Computer software is helping people with Alzheimer's practice repetitive memory games. These games improve their memory enough that some become functional again.\nOther brain disorders may also be treatable by using repetitive exercises. Born with cerebral palsy, Sara had a useless right arm. Researchers immobilized her good left arm, thus forcing the 5‐year‐old to use only her right arm for a few hours a day. In less than a year, Sara's right arm became functional.\n\"It sounds almost too simple and too obvious,\" said one researcher. \"For years, people have used repetitive training to become better at games, sports, and other activities. Why has it taken us this long to realize that we can also train the brain? Simple repetitive practice may restore normal brain function for many patients of all ages.\" 8.6, 244"

The speaker will be James Carter, the director of a nonprofit organization dedicated to making the golden years fun and interesting.\n\"We have too many seniors who act old because they think they're old,\" said Carter. \"Our goal is to help seniors realize that they're as young and active as they want to be. Getting older does not mean sitting around waiting to die. It means getting out and doing all the things you never had time to do while you were working and raising a family.\"\nCarter will identify the services and activities that are available to seniors locally and statewide. Included are legal aid, tax advice, discounts for bus and taxi travel in the city, and free blood pressure testing on the first Monday of each month. Testing for diabetes and for cataracts is offered four times a year for a nominal fee. The city also provides inexpensive dinners called Meals on Wheels. Volunteers deliver these meals to seniors who are homebound because of illness or injury.\nAn Internet class begins this month for seniors who want to visit the World Wide Web. \"Many seniors still use typewriters,\" said Carter. \"They see no need for a computer. But after they take this course, some of them may decide to buy their own laptops.\"\nNew activities at the Senior Center include Bingo on Friday and Saturday nights, with a grand prize of $50 each night. The center is also offering Strength Training classes. \"As you get older,\" said Carter, \"you need to keep both your mind and your body active. An active mind helps prevent Alzheimer's, and an active body helps prevent osteoporosis.\"",

There are billions of these bacteria in our intestines and in our feces. Of the hundreds of strains of good E. coli, there are only a few strains that are bad for us. These strains usually cause stomach problems and diarrhea.\nThe worst of these strains is labeled E. coli 0157. This strain is common in healthy cows, sheep, and goats.

Hospitalization and transfusions are necessary to prevent death.\nMost people just get mildly sick from E. coli 0157. There are usually just two symptoms: stomach cramps and diarrhea (non‐bloody or bloody). These symptoms may last up to two weeks. The very young and the very old are most susceptible to severe symptoms. In the U.S., more than 100,000 people get infected annually. People who live in countries with contaminated water develop immunity to infection.\nThe primary sources of infection are contaminated water, undercooked hamburger, unwashed fruits and vegetables, and unpasteurized milk or milk products. Swimming in or swallowing contaminated lake water can also result in infection. In the U.S., outbreaks involving hundreds of people have been traced to undercooked hamburgers at fast food restaurants, to packaged vegetable products such as spinach, and even to petting zoos.

To submit a new word, go to bushwhaacked.com.\nIn addition to putting Bush's name everywhere, Maher's group also wants to see Bush's face plastered all over America. They are talking to many different companies. Waste Management, the largest trash company in America, might put Bush's face on the rear end of all their trash trucks, Maher said.\nIn addition, he hopes that Kimberly‐Clark will put Bush's face on their paper towels, tissue paper, toilet paper, and disposable diapers. \"I can't wait to blow my nose into Bush's face,\" said Maher, laughing.\nSeveral companies are eager to work with Maher's group. He said that the public will soon see Bush's face on dartboards, welcome mats, and the bottom of trash cans and kitty litter boxes. One company is putting his face on their fly swatters. \"Bush ruined this country,\" said Maher, \"so we want to ruin his image.

Over a 10‐year period, Jones had managed to swindle almost $10 million from thousands of gullible people throughout the state.\nHe advertised his fantastic ideas on TV. \"For some reason,\" Jones said, \"TV seems to break the ice. Even though you are a total stranger to the viewer, once he sees you on TV in his home, he feels like he knows you. You enter his living room and become a trusted friend.\"\nJones had an imagination that wouldn't quit. One time he showed viewers an \"official government\" earthquake report which \"proved\" that the western half of California would collapse into the sea within three years. For $100, he said, Jones would insure their house and property for full value. Thousands of people who saw that TV ad sent him a hundred dollars each.\nIn another TV ad, Jones claimed that he had negotiated with the federal and state governments for exclusive air rights. He told viewers that, for only $100, they could own the first 500 miles directly above all their property. They would be able to charge any commercial plane that flew over their property $100 per crossing. They would also be able to charge government rockets, satellites, space shuttles, and space stations $100 for each and every violation of their air rights.\nAnother time, Jones claimed to have invented a product that gets rid of calories. He showed the viewers a spray can of \"NoCal.\" He said that after they sprayed NoCal on their food, a chemical interaction would cause all the calories in the food to simply evaporate within about 10 seconds. The NoCal was only $10 a can. As usual, Jones received thousands of checks in the mail.\nThe judge told Jones that he should be ashamed of himself. Jones responded that he was very ashamed of himself, and that when he got out of prison he hoped to become a TV consultant to help people avoid getting scammed. He told the judge that he was already developing an instructional CD that, for merely $100, would save people thousands of dollars in scams. The judge nodded, and then changed Jones's sentence from 10 years to 12 years.",

If she had taken the 26‐year payout, Doris Stevens would have received $11 million a year for 26 years, before taxes.\nMrs. Stevens decided to take the lump sum payment. People who take the lump sum get paid within 60 days, but their total payment is reduced by almost 40 percent. Mrs. Stevens' lump sum was $168 million, but after the federal tax was applied, she received $110 million. That's the amount that Mrs. Stevens got to put in her purse.\nRecently divorced, Mrs. Stevens says that her ex‐husband has already called her to ask about a \"loan.\" She laughed. \"I wouldn't lend him a quarter to call the police if he was getting robbed. Let him borrow money from his new young girlfriend who makes him so happy.\"\nWhat is Mrs. Stevens going to do with her windfall? \"Well, the first thing I'm going to do is to help out my children and grandchildren, of course. Second, I hope to revolutionize the housecleaning industry.\"\nA housecleaner for her entire life, Mrs. Stevens says she's going to establish a National Housecleaner Helper Corporation. Her corporation would focus on giving seed money to various individuals and research firms to develop more efficient and more powerful housecleaning solvents and tools.\n\"When was the last time you saw something new in housecleaning?\" Mrs. Stevens asked. \"They keep claiming they've invented new products that remove any and all blemishes, but they still haven't invented a product that removes an ordinary ballpoint ink stain from your ordinary white shirt. This industry needs some new products. I hope to revolutionize the cleaning world, so that my 'sisters' will have an easier time of it in the future. We've all spent too much time on our hands and knees. If men had to do housecleaning, you know that they'd be inventing more powerful products every week.\" 8.2, 330"

The Marines do whatever the federal government tells them to do, and the government always talks about how important the Marines are and how grateful the government is. So when a former marine, James Reid, recently applied for a Purple Heart for a wound that he received while serving in the Korean War more than 50 years ago, he expected no problems. But a Navy official said that they had no more Purple Hearts. If Reid wanted one, he could buy it at a military supply store. \"They're only $42,\" said Arthur Chertoff. \"It's not exactly like buying a new car.\"\nHowever, the 75‐year‐old Reid subsists on a military pension that barely covers his rent. His daughter and son send him money for food, transportation, and other expenses. \"Well, then, let your kids pay for it,\" Chertoff said when Reid told him that he depended on his kids for living expenses. So Reid asked his son for $42 for the medal. His son got so upset about the ungratefulness of the Navy that he called the local newspaper.\nThe local newspaper printed a front page article about how the Navy couldn't be bothered to pay for and present Reid his Purple Heart 50 years after his injury. Network television news picked up the story. The Navy, of course, was immediately embarrassed. Somehow, officials found the money and the time to buy Reid his Purple Heart and even make a ceremonial presentation.\n\"We are always eager and happy to show that we take care of our own,\" said the broadly smiling Chertoff as he presented Reid the medal in front of TV news cameras. \"Thank you so much for your service to your country.\"",

        "text": "A Continental Pacific Railroad freight train derailed on Tuesday about 40 miles north of Sacramento. The exact cause is still being investigated, but authorities say it was no accident. The head engineer said everything was fine; then suddenly, everything wasn't.\nOf the freight train's 86 cars, 22 went off the tracks. Fortunately, this incident did not involve any fatalities, human or otherwise. The head engineer was treated for a broken wrist at a nearby hospital. He was the only casualty.\nTrains throughout California frequently carry dangerous cargoes, such as chemicals. When these trains derail, authorities immediately evacuate nearby communities because of the danger of explosions or of harmful fumes.

The biggest problem, however, was the cattle. About 300 of them were standing on or near the tracks, wandering into the nearby woods, or standing on the nearby highway. Traffic on the two‐lane highway was backed up for almost a mile in each direction.\n\"We know who did this,\" said a California Highway Patrol spokesman. \"The train was sabotaged by a group called 'Tofu for You.'

More than 1,000 locals and visitors strolled through the shady park daily, as temperatures remained in the comfortable 70s all weekend.\nAll kinds of art were on display and for sale. Prices ranged from a couple of dollars to a couple of thousand dollars. Oscar, a native of Peru, was selling his beautiful paintings of the mountain village of Ayacucho, where he lives most of the year. \"Every year I come to the United States to sell my paintings at about five different art shows. Then I return to my country. That is where I do all my paintings, in our beautiful mountains.\"\nPeter is a photographer. He travels throughout the southwest U.S. One of his favorite areas is northeast Arizona. \"That's where Spider Rock is,\" he said, pointing to a beautiful color photograph of a towering sandstone spire about 800 feet high. This rock, according to Navajo Indian lore, was the home of Spider Woman, a goddess revered by the tribe.\nA Navajo woman was selling her own rug weavings at the fair. She was busy creating a rug while visitors watched. When asked how long it took, she replied that her creations usually took months. She said that Navajo tradition was to always weave a slight flaw into an article so as not to offend Spider Woman, because only Spider Woman could create a perfect weave.\nThe exhibit areas were located throughout the park. Artists' creations included jewelry, ceramics, bird houses, gourd art, furniture, pottery, handmade musical instruments, music CDs, and sculpture. Almost all the artists had their work displayed beneath shady canopies.\n\"This was another successful year for our art fair,\" said the head librarian. \"The artists sold enough of their work to encourage them to return next year, and the library raised almost $700 from sales of various items.

Frozen French fries—sliced, fried in oil, and then packaged—are now approved as \"fresh vegetables\" by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nThe French fry industry has been petitioning the USDA for years to get this approval. They say that their product is similar to cucumbers that have a wax coating. They argue that they use 100‐percent vegetable oil, which is much healthier for consumers than plain wax.\nMost consumers, of course, beg to differ. \"You must be joking,\" said Annie, 50. \"How can you consider a product that's deep‐fried in oil to be a fresh vegetable? Even if I steamed broccoli, I could no longer call it fresh broccoli—it's cooked! I wish I were a lobbyist, so my congressman would help me. Unfortunately, I'm only a tax‐paying citizen.\"\nThe USDA defends its decision, saying that potatoes undeniably are vegetables. Although French fries are fried in oil, they are still potatoes. If you let them sit on your countertop for a couple of weeks, a USDA spokesman said, the fries \"will rot\" just like all other fresh vegetables.\nConsumer advocates say the USDA has totally lost touch with consumers. \"They'd probably declare that eggshells are nutritious if a lobbyist asked them to,\" said one advocate.",

        "text": "A routine check of the main building on the Rest in Peace Cemetery in Santa Fe turned up thousands of cardboard boxes containing the remains of cremated people. An inspector from the state's Cemetery and Funeral Bureau found the boxes stacked neatly in various rooms of the cemetery's main building. Instead of having names of the departed, most boxes simply had dates inscribed on them. The dates went all the way back to June 14, 1930.\nThe owner of the cemetery, Mrs. Marbles, said she had just bought the property a year ago. She said she had never even been in many of the rooms of the main building. She said that she had bought the cemetery solely for its land value.\n\"As we all know,\" she said, \"God keeps making people, but He's not making any more land. It's only a matter of time before all this land is going to be needed for the living. When that happens, this property will be worth at least ten times what I paid for it. I'm already in discussions with several condo developers.\"\nThe inspector said that it looked like most of the remains were from the 1930s to the 1970s. He figured that the people were probably homeless people whose bodies were never claimed at the funeral homes. The funeral homes cremated the bodies and then gave the remains to the cemetery for proper burial. He said that even though these remains were up to 75 years old, they would be buried with dignity and respect.\n\"After all,\" he said, \"all of these people had relatives at one time. They might even have children and grandchildren living right here in Santa Fe. For all I know, one of them might even be Mrs. Marbles' grandpa.\" 8.0, 296"

        "text": "It was early morning, January 17, 1994. Jim and his wife Alicia were asleep in their house in Northridge, California. Suddenly, the loudest thunder they'd ever heard seemed to explode right through the ceiling, the floor, and the walls. They were thrown onto the floor. The dresser, on the other side of the bed, crashed onto the bed, which was shaking and bouncing violently. Paintings and a mirror flew off the bedroom walls. Their bedroom windows broke and the walls cracked as the foundation of the house moved.\nTheir cat took off through a window and didn't return for three days. Their two dogs covered their heads with their paws. Jim and Alicia scrambled to pick up the dogs and get out of the house, fearing that the roof and walls were going to collapse on them. They breathed easier once outside and saw their neighbors also running out of their houses. Jim and Alicia were only a half mile from the epicenter of the earthquake. Despite the wreckage to their home, which they had just bought, they considered themselves lucky just to be alive. They thought at first that they had just lived through the Big One, the one that scientists had said for years was going to destroy much of the Los Angeles area. But this wasn't the Big One. It was big, but not nearly as big as the one that's yet to come.\nThe Northridge quake was \"only\" 6.8 on the Richter scale (10 is maximum). There have been many earthquakes stronger than the Northridge one. The strongest quake ever recorded, 9.5, occurred in Chile in 1960. An earthquake in the Indian Ocean in December 2004 produced a tsunami that traveled at over 300 mph to hit Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand, and neighboring countries, killing 230,000 people. The underwater earthquake was measured at 9.0, and it produced as much energy as 1,000 atomic bombs.\nEach whole number on the Richter scale equals ten times the energy of the previous number. That is, a 3.0 quake is ten times as powerful as a 2.0 quake. Quakes are measured on instruments called seismographs.\nEarthquakes usually occur where tectonic plates meet. About 30 of these plates cover the Earth. They are several miles thick and huge in area—most of the Pacific Ocean sits on just one plate.\nEarthquakes occur when one plate strikes another or slides beneath another. Either action produces a huge amount of energy that travels upwards to the surface of the land or upwards to the surface of the ocean floor. A powerful ocean earthquake produces a tsunami, a fast‐moving wave that can be anywhere from a few feet high to as much as 100 feet high, as in 2004.\nIt is well known that various kinds of animals act oddly just before an earthquake occurs. Researchers hope to discover how these animals can actually detect an earthquake, and which animals are best at accurately detecting earthquakes. They'll use that knowledge to try to create an early warning system to save human lives. Humans will never be able to take the power out of an earthquake, but maybe someday, with the help of animals and technology, they can take the surprise out."

The occasional cough or sneeze from a nearby stranger doesn't transmit TB.\nMany people think TB is rare, like bubonic plague or smallpox.

In the U.S., TB killed 650 people in 2005.\nCaused by bacteria, most forms of TB can be treated with antibiotics. The antibiotics must be taken for weeks, however, before the victim completely recovers. Ignoring doctor's orders, some victims stop taking their antibiotics as soon as they start feeling better; they risk catching a stronger version of TB in the future.\nTB usually attacks the lungs. Symptoms vary. But common symptoms include fatigue, lots of coughing, loss of appetite, chest pain, and spitting up blood. A simple skin test, followed if necessary by a chest x‐ray, will determine if active TB exists. If so, a doctor will prescribe antibiotics.\nMore than a billion people have inactive TB.

They don't even have to go to the immigration office. Info Pass is a website that they can access on their home computer or a library computer.\nTo beat the crowds, immigrants in Los Angeles used to get in line the night before.

To get media attention, they usually remove their blouses and bras.\n\"We didn't do that originally,\" said Diane Boxer, \"but we never got any media coverage either. As soon as we took our tops off, we got nationwide coverage. All of a sudden we were on the six and eleven o'clock news.

But nowadays, even the wrong media coverage is better than no coverage.\"\nAbout 20 members of the group had planned to protest the governor's speech today. He is trying to drum up support for his proposition requiring school teachers to pay for their students' books. But when Gov. Arnold heard about the protest, he called the state's attorney general. The governor knew that no one would pay attention to his speech if there were topless women nearby.\nThe attorney general told the group that their \"display\" would cause multiple auto crashes and corrupt innocent, wide‐eyed children. He said that if they dared to go topless, they would be hauled off to jail.\n\"We have held fifteen protests statewide and have yet to cause one accident or corrupt one innocent child,\" scoffed Boxer.\n\"These are wonderful ladies, but they do not understand.

They had contracted with a magazine for the photo, and then donated the money to a charity for children. A couple of years before that, a photo of Brad and Angelina walking along an African beach sold for $400,000. So celebrity photos, contracted or candid, can make a photographer wealthy. But the stalking that goes on can make a celebrity crazy; recently, an actor punched out a photographer.\nStalking can be dangerous to the public, too. Recently, paparazzi in nine different cars chased after Britney Spears as she left a friend's house to go to a nearby restaurant. The driver of one car, intent on beating his competitors, struck a man in a crosswalk. The man was taken to the hospital with two broken legs. Nobody took his photo.\nThat accident prompted the mayor's decision. The very cost of the license, he said, would reduce the number of photographers who hang around in Malibu. \"Good riddance,\" said one restaurant owner. \"Some of them hang around my restaurant every Saturday.

They just use my restroom all day long.\"\nThe paparazzi, of course, were angry. \"We're just little people trying to make a buck,\" said Ansel Adams. \"Most of us never have big paydays.

The light becomes an image on the retina, which converts the image into nerve impulses. Your brain reads these impulses and \"tells\" you what you are seeing. The image that the retina receives is upside down, but your brain reverses it to right‐side up. That's it, in a nutshell—or, in an eyeball, if you'd prefer.\nIn an experiment years ago, a brave researcher wore special lenses that turned everything upside down. He had no idea if his brain would be able to reverse everything after he stopped wearing the special lenses. After stumbling around for a while, he became used to the lenses because his brain corrected the images. To conclude his experiment, he stopped wearing the lenses. After a while, to his great relief, his brain returned his vision to normal.\nYour pupils get bigger as a light source gets dimmer, but they also get bigger if you see something, like a delicious meal, that interests you. \"Your eyes are bigger than your stomach\" is an expression parents use when a child fills his plate with more food than he can eat.\nPeople with vision problems are usually near‐sighted or far‐sighted. Near‐sighted people see clearly only objects that are near; far‐sighted people see clearly only objects that are far away. Both groups of people need corrective lenses (glasses or contacts).\nPeople whose near and far vision is good have \"20/20\" vision. People with poor eyesight might have 20/40 vision or worse. That is, a person with good vision can see an object from 40 feet away as clearly as a person with poor vision can see the object from 20 feet away. No matter how good their vision is when they are young, most people will need reading glasses when they get old. And we can thank an Italian for inventing glasses and an American for inventing bifocals.\nJust as there are only seven colors in the rainbow, there are only six basic colors for people's eyes: amber, blue, brown, gray, green, and hazel. Brown is by far the most common color, with blue a distant second. Sometimes people mistakenly say that their eyes are black, but only their pupils are black, not their irises. Occasionally you will meet a person whose eyes are two different colors! 7.8, 411"

In the old days, fairs and carnivals usually had a \"Test Your Strength\" contest that required a player to swing a small sledge hammer as hard as he could to ring a bell and get a prize. The Japanese invention also challenges a player's strength. Players can set it to four different levels: Baby, Girl, Man, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nThe mechanical arm operates at half strength for the first 10 seconds: \"Baby,\" for example, would be \"half Baby,\" or 50‐percent full strength, for 10 seconds initially.\n\"This gives the human time to evaluate his mechanical opponent, and usually allows him to win,\" says the inventor. But after 10 seconds elapse, the mechanical arm instantly achieves full strength, so that weak Baby suddenly becomes strong Baby. \"That comes as a surprise to the human,\" said the inventor. \"If you watch the human compete, you will see a look of surprise come over his face at the machine's sudden burst of strength. It's funny to see!\"\nUnfortunately for some players, the look of surprise is followed by the look of pain, as the steel and plastic arm breaks their flesh and blood arm! Two players recently went to the hospital. The inventor said that he wouldn't put a warning sign on the machine.\n\"It's not the machine's fault,\" he said. \"Humans often think that they're smarter, faster, and stronger than they actually are. I think it's a good lesson that they are learning. Many refuse to combat the machine at the Baby or Girl level because they think that they're equal to the Man or Arnold level. They don't know their limitations. They're proud and foolish, and some of them have to pay the price for their pride.\"",

        "grade": 7.6,
        "text": "An eight‐lane steel bridge on Interstate 35 collapsed during evening rush hour. Dozens of cars plummeted 60 feet into the Mississippi River. Ten people died, and more than 50 were seriously injured. The bridge was being repaired because it was found to be structurally deficient; it needed to be reinforced. Like many bridges throughout America, the bridge was built more than 40 years ago. Traffic was much lighter then. Nowadays, cars, buses, and big trucks cross the bridge steadily, even late at night.\n\"I heard a terrific boom. It was like the loudest thunder I ever heard,\" said one witness to the disaster. She ran out of her car to see what was happening. She saw cars falling into the river and heard people screaming. She heard the loud cracking sounds of the bridge collapsing and splashing sounds as bridge sections and vehicles hit the water. \"It was horrible,\" she said.\nEngineers had no explanation for the collapse. They said the bridge had been inspected recently. The report said that, although it was structurally deficient, the bridge was not unsafe. Since the report did not declare the bridge unsafe, the decision was to simply reinforce it at strategic locations.\nAmericans were shocked that an American bridge could simply collapse. The news was all over TV, radio, and most newspapers. One newspaper investigation revealed that almost 10 percent (about 59,000) of America's bridges were structurally deficient.\nInitially, some people speculated that terrorists might have rigged a bomb to the bridge. Others noted that all the pigeon poop on the bridge's support rails might have eroded the steel. One blogger wrote that, before he drove over another bridge in America, he would make sure that a life jacket was in the front seat next to him.",

It discovered that AA was reacting to a 50‐percent increase in fuel prices in the last year alone. The memo warned pilots to put only the amount of fuel into the plane that was necessary to reach the destination.\nThe memo reminded pilots that their primary responsibility was to ensure that AA's profits increased every quarter. Topping off the tanks resulted in extra fueling time and extra weight. The extra time and weight were reducing company profits. The memo concluded with these instructions: turn off the engines when stuck in long lines on the runways; if there is a strong tailwind, turn off all the engines and glide; and, wherever it is available, use \"economy\" jet fuel.\nPilots immediately complained, saying that such a policy put their lives and the public's lives at great risk. Yielding to their complaints, AA allowed pilots to put in an extra ten gallons of fuel.\nEven with the extra ten gallons, Rogers had two near disasters. The first time, his plane ran out of fuel just as the wheels touched the runway. His plane had to be towed to the terminal. Rogers received a congratulatory phone call from AA's president. The second time, Rogers had to land his plane on a freeway, still under construction, 10 miles short of the Atlanta runway. This time the president told him he was making AA look bad. He told Rogers to save fuel AND land at the airport.\n\"People have no idea how little AA cares about their safety,\" Rogers said. \"Saving fuel is more important to management than saving lives.\"",

Yielding to their complaints, AA <+===+> pilots to put in an extra ten gallons <+===+> fuel. <+===+>Even with the extra ten gallons, Rogers <+===+> two near disasters. The first time, his plane <+===+> out of fuel just as the wheels touched <+===+> runway. His plane had to be towed to <+===+> terminal. Rogers received a congratulatory phone call from <+===+>'s president! The second time, Rogers had to land <+===+> plane on a freeway, still under construction, 10 <+===+> short of the Atlanta runway. This time the <+===+> told him he was making AA look bad. <+===+> told Rogers to save fuel AND land at <+===+> airport. <+===+>“People have no idea how little AA <+===+> about their safety,” Rogers said. “Saving fuel is <+===+> important to management than saving lives.” ",

Although the influenza virus is alive throughout the world in all four seasons, it seems to have its greatest impact on humans during the winter. Scientists are not sure why. They think it's because in the winter people are indoors and close together for longer periods of time. Also, the virus might be able to live longer and be stronger in colder weather. Finally, indoor air can dry up the mucous that helps protect people from the virus.\nIn the U.S., the virus is not something to sneeze at. It kills about 36,000 people annually (most of them elderly). It also causes almost 250,000 people to end up in a hospital bed annually.\nScientists develop a preventive flu shot for people to take as winter begins. This shot is not guaranteed to prevent flu; scientists can only guess at which virus might be the most dangerous in the upcoming season. The shot protects against only that particular virus. For those who do not get the shot, influenza spreads among them easily. It takes only a sneeze, a cough, or a touch. Victims frequently get ill from shaking hands, opening doors, or handling money.\nMost infected people will have a fever, sore throat, and cough.

The agent, standing in the middle of a two‐lane road, had motioned the dealer's vehicle to stop. Instead, the dealer ran over the agent, killing him, and then drove back across the border into Mexico. He has not been caught yet. Such incidents are on the rise, said one agent. The dealers are getting braver, because they rarely get caught. \"Any agent who tries to stop us deserves to die,\" said one convicted drug dealer.\nThe dealers are always devising new tricks to get their drugs into the U.S. They start dangerous fires near the border to distract agents. They shoot cattle on border ranches so that American ranchers will not call agents about suspicious activity. They use dynamite to blow up bridges so agents cannot follow them. They dig tunnels that start in Mexico and connect with buildings on U.S. soil.\nTheir newest trick is to try to behead agents who ride on ATVs (all‐terrain vehicles). When an agent drives into a concealed trap, he activates a \"clothes line\" wire. This wire stretches tightly across the agent's path, at neck level. It could slice right through his neck. The Department of Homeland Security quickly issued a new protective device for its ATV riders—a plastic neck guard. Using computer simulation, the department determined that the neck guard should prevent beheading; however, critical injuries, including a broken neck, are still possible.\n\"These 'clothes lines' are not a big deal,\" said a department official. He criticized the media for making a mountain out of a molehill. \"Wait until an agent is actually beheaded—then you'll have a story,\" he said to a group of reporters.",

        "text": "A 24‐year‐old Los Angeles man was taken to a hospital and then to county jail after leading police on a one‐hour freeway chase in a stolen SUV. The chase ended in downtown Los Angeles in front of the Spring Hotel. Most of the chase was uneventful, except for an empty bottle of whiskey that the driver threw at one police vehicle.\nWhen the driver got into downtown, things started to happen. He ran over a fire hydrant. The water spewed out of the hydrant, causing a geyser that ruined all the books in several carts that a vendor had put outside to attract customers into his bookstore. The driver hurriedly turned west onto Grand Avenue and managed to bang into three parked cars on one side of that street and two cars on the other side. The driver also tried to run over a police officer, who was standing in the crosswalk ordering him to halt.\nTurning north, the driver caused a bus to slam on its brakes to avoid a collision. The bus was empty, and the bus driver was uninjured. However, two police cars that were pursuing the SUV from different directions were not so lucky. One of them ran into the front of the bus, and the other into the back. Because the drivers had braked early enough, the damage to their cars was minor. Both officers resumed the chase.\nThey only went two blocks north to find that the SUV had come to a full stop because it had plowed into a newspaper stand. The driver, who was not wearing a seatbelt, was slumped behind the steering wheel. The proprietor of the newsstand was yelling at the driver and shaking a magazine at him. The police called for the ambulance. They charged the driver with failure to yield to a police officer and driving under the influence.",

        "text": "A local community college professor decided to fight back. \"The price of books for our students is just getting higher and higher and, combined with the rising cost of tuition, it's killing these kids,\" said Peter Jason, Ph.D. \"Remember, students are one of the poorest groups of people in America. Almost half of them have at least one part‐time job. In fact, one of my students has three jobs. She is a part‐time sales clerk at a clothing store three days a week, then works three evenings a week as a pizza cook, and on weekends she does manicures at a beauty salon. And she still manages to have a high GPA and go to school full‐time.\"\nTextbook prices are traditionally high. Adding to that problem, many college instructors change textbooks year after year; they either upgrade to a new edition or switch to an entirely different textbook. This further hurts students because, if an instructor no longer uses a particular textbook, that book has no resale value.\nDr. Jason decided to make life a little easier and a lot cheaper for his students by writing his own book on public speaking. \"Many books have an increased price because of bells and whistles: CD‐ROMs, lots of color photographs, and lots of graphics. I talked to my students, and many of them, like me, prefer to keep things simple. So, during a sabbatical a few years ago, I wrote my own textbook. I made sure that it wasn't long‐winded. I called it 'Successful Public Speaking: How to Be Brief, Concise, and to the Point.'\n\"Compared to most other public speaking primers, mine is half the number of pages, and one‐third the price. That is, $30 instead of $90. Plus, it is published in a three‐ring binder format. So, when I wrote a second edition last year, students only had to buy the 35 new pages and delete 35 of the original pages. For only $7, they had upgraded to the new edition. I've had great feedback from my students about this loose‐leaf concept. Maybe the word will get out, and more writers and publishers will try it.\"",

        "grade": 7.4,
        "text": "The Silas Lake Park reopens today after being closed for six months. The park was closed because mud and rock slides destroyed part of Cambridge Road, the only access into the park. \"We had to remove tons of boulders and rocks,\" said Hugh Foster of the Parks and Recreation Department. \"Then we had to rebuild a bridge and reconstruct almost a mile of highway. I'm really surprised we got it done so soon.\"\nThe park is three miles north of Colfax on Highway 28. Cambridge Road is a two‐lane highway that winds upward through Pearl Canyon before it descends to Silas Lake, which has about 20 miles of shoreline. The largest lake in the county, it is also famous for bass. In fact, the record largemouth bass catch in California occurred there in 1975. A 14‐year‐old boy caught a 19‐pound bass.\nThe lake has two ramps for boaters, a full‐service restaurant, a snack bar, a small tackle store, and a boat rental facility. As with all county parks, no alcohol is sold or permitted. More than 100 picnic tables have protective roofs and big barbecue pits. There are public restrooms with free shower facilities, lots of trash cans, and hiking trails for nature lovers. The west side of the park includes a softball field, a soccer field, and two volleyball courts. Horseshoes and kite‐flying are two other popular activities. In the summer, a designated swimming area has a lifeguard on duty seven days a week.\nThe entry fee is $10 per vehicle and $10 per boat. Reservations are not accepted. The parking lot holds about 500 vehicles; if it is full, no additional vehicles are allowed to enter. Latecomers either leave or wait in line for someone to leave the parking lot. Some weekends there are three dozen vehicles waiting in line outside the gate. Because of many requests, park officials soon might start permitting campers to stay overnight on weekends.\nThe park is open from dawn to 10 p.m. during the summer. \"We probably average 2,000 people here every day during the summer,\" said Foster. \"They come here to fish, swim, water‐ski, jet‐ski, picnic, commune with Mother Nature—you name it. People love this place.\"",

They were at her house to arrest her for the 1970 murder of her young stepdaughter. Castle apparently realized that she was going to be arrested. Only a month earlier she had been interviewed by detectives about Dorothy's death 35 years ago.\nIn 1970, Castle told police that the girl had fallen out of a tree she was climbing and hit her head on a rock. But Dorothy's natural father, Dwayne, who was married to Castle at the time, thought his wife was lying. \"She said she would hurt me if I bother her again,\" Dorothy had told her father earlier.\n\"Your little girl is making up stories about me. I try to love her, but she rejects me,\" Castle told Dwayne.\nAn autopsy was inconclusive, and the death was ruled accidental. Dwayne divorced Castle shortly thereafter.\nBut the case was reopened recently when a playmate of Dorothy's came forward. Beverly Lisenby, also seven at that time, said she was about to knock on the door of Dorothy's house that fateful day. But instead of knocking, she listened quietly as she heard Dorothy screaming for help and Castle telling her to shut up. Beverly listened until it was silent inside, then ran back home. She was so shaken by the event that she had \"told no one in all these years.\"\nThe coroner dug up Dorothy's body and did a second autopsy. Using new crime‐solving tools, he determined that Dorothy had been struck in the skull several times by a rock the size of a baseball. The police are now trying to locate Dwayne to tell him the good news.",

The bus driver, walking along the highway when arrested by the police, was initially charged with \"leaving a child unattended while motor vehicle is running.\" While that is only a minor driving violation, the county district attorney said he hoped to upgrade the charge to a felony because of the number of children involved.\n\"Whatever he is charged with,\" the DA said, \"I will see that he never drives a bus in this county again.\"",

        "text": "If you could combine 100 of the best minds in the history of mankind into one super‐brain, would that super‐brain be able to fully know and appreciate all the wonders of the universe? Probably not. The universe is simply too big, too wondrous, too fantastic for even a super‐human to know and to appreciate.\nImagine an ant crawling all over an elephant. That ant has little or no idea of what that elephant is all about. Imagine a tiny fish swimming next to a giant blue whale. That fish has little or no idea of how complex and magnificent that blue whale is. Similarly, we humans do not know, nor will we ever know, all the wonders of our universe. It's just too big, and our minds are just too small.\nFor example, many of us take the sun for granted; sometimes we even complain about it! How many of us marvel at it, wondering about its seemingly infinite power and energy? Yet the sun is but one of uncountable billions of stars in the universe. And each is remarkable in many ways, and in its own way.\nJust as there are billions of different heavenly bodies, there are billions of different earthly bodies. Look at all the variety we have here just on our planet. We have seven billion people, and they all look different! How can that be? So many cats and dogs and cows look alike, yet it's rare that we find two people who look exactly like each other. Look at all the different birds and fish we have, the different two‐legged, four‐legged, six‐legged, and eight‐legged (and more legged!) animals we have, and all the different and beautiful plants. And all of these creatures are doing their own thing. What a marvelous world we live in. Yet, if you point out how fantastic a plant or an animal or even a rock is to someone, how often will that person respond by saying, \"So?\"\nSadly, too many of us are too busy with our \"ant\" lives to appreciate the elephant, or too busy with our \"fish\" lives to wonder at the blue whale. Like the ants and the fish, we all have our jobs to do, and if we don't do them, our existence and our survival are threatened. So, many of us have to ignore the wonders that Mother Nature has presented us, as we focus on the hard work of just surviving. But even when we have free time, we continue to ignore the wonders of the world, instead focusing our attention on activities that relax and please us.\nIt seems that the only time we marvel at nature is when it gets angry and ugly. But even then, we still have no idea, and never will, of how angry and ugly nature can get."

His mother, who was driving, was uninjured. She said that the truck appeared out of nowhere, and she thought she was going to die.

The man denied drinking, but he failed the police test for sobriety. When asked to touch his nose with his arms outstretched and eyes closed, he was unable to touch any part of his head.\nThe handcuffed man asked the police if they knew where \"Mabel\" was as he was put into the back seat of the police vehicle.

The couple, visiting from Texas, had booked a room for eight nights.\n\"They wanted a sterile environment,\" Theodore said. \"They should have rented a room in a hospital, maybe an operating room. This hotel is clean, but it isn't that clean.\"\nTheodore said that, on the very first day, the couple brought all the sheets, pillowcases, and bedspreads down to the main lobby and just dropped them next to the front desk. They stood there next to this pile of bedding while other guests looked, pointed, and murmured. The hotel got three cancellations within the hour from people who witnessed this strange event.\nWhen Theodore asked the couple what the problem was, they said that their bedding was filthy and they wanted it replaced. The couple could not identify any specific \"filth\" on the bedding. The wife just said, \"We're paying good money to stay here. How dare you doubt us! We know the filth is there. That's all the proof you need.\" Theodore called room service, and the bedding was replaced immediately.\nEarly the next evening, however, the couple marched to the front desk again and demanded seven cans of spray disinfectant. \"We need a can for each night. We have to spray the phone, the TV, all the door handles, the toilet handle, the shower stall, the faucet, the sink, and any hotel staff entering our room.\"\nWorried about what their demands might be in the following days, Theodore politely suggested that a hotel more suitable for them was just around the corner. He then called ahead to reserve a \"very clean\" room, and gave them free transportation in the hotel limousine.\n\"They seemed surprised that I suggested a different hotel, but they liked the idea that I didn't charge them for the second day, and they really liked the limousine service,\" said Theodore.",

        "text": "The seal population just south of Monterey, California, is making life difficult for the surfer population. There have been several incidents in the past month of surfers being bitten or attacked by seals. Scientists think it is merely a result of overcrowding. Over the past 10 years, the seals have made \"their\" beach bigger to suit their growing population.\nThe seal‐loving activists say that the surfers should surf elsewhere. They say that the surfers are infringing on the seals' territory and making them nervous and irritable. Sometimes, when there are too many surfers, they actually cause the seals to leave the beach. This, the activists say, deprives nature lovers of the opportunity to enjoy watching and listening to the seals. The activists argue that this area should be off limits to surfers.\nSurfers, of course, don't see it quite that way. They think that it's good if the seals get hit in the head with a loose surfboard occasionally, because that will teach them to stay on their rocks and stay away from the surfers' part of the beach.\n\"They shouldn't be allowed to have their rocks and our beach, too,\" exclaimed one blond, tan, thin 16‐year‐old who refused to identify himself. \"All these seals think about is me, me, me! They need to learn to share. Can't someone just train them to clear out of here from about 1:00 to sunset? They could come back here and stay all night and all morning. That makes sense to me.\"\nThe park service is going to hold a public hearing on the issue. They know it's going to be a tough issue to settle, because neither the activists nor the surfers seem willing to compromise. A similar issue in San Diego was settled in the seals' favor. Surfers were prohibited from using the seals' area. Mysteriously, the seals eventually vacated that particular area, and the surfers were allowed to return."

They say that prison officials must charge the prisoner with some type of violation before they can punish him by making him eat nutraloaf. At least one prisoner has filed a lawsuit against the use of nutraloaf. Prison officials say the prisoners are overreacting. They say that nutraloaf is a nutritious food. \"It's just like fruitcake,\" said one warden. Nutraloaf is a mixture of bread, cheese, raw and cooked vegetables, beans, and other ingredients which may vary from season to season and prison to prison.\nPrison officials say that using nutraloaf, a \"hand\" food, increases prison safety, because prisoners don't have utensils or plates to throw at or use against guards or other prisoners. Officials routinely distribute nutraloaf for days at a time when one or more prisoners act unruly.\n\"What are they complaining about? I wish I could have had nutraloaf when I was growing up,\" said Bob Hope, a prison warden in Arkansas. \"It tastes a lot better than the grits and corn bread I ate every day. These guys have a lot of nerve to complain. I've eaten it myself many times. I just pop it into the microwave for a minute, spread a little butter on it, and enjoy. What's their beef?

        "text": "A zoo employee was bitten by an African puff adder, a large poisonous snake. He was trying to put the snake into a bag so that it could be moved to a new snake house. The snake handler was wearing heavy gloves and thick boots, but the adder sank its fangs into the man's neck. The handler squeezed the snake's neck tightly, forcing the snake to withdraw its fangs. He then put the snake into the bag and tied the bag.\nHe called 911 to report that he had been bitten by the adder. When paramedics arrived at the new snake house, neither snake nor man was there. The paramedics started walking back toward the old snake house. A few moments later, they found the handler lying unconscious on a pathway. Curiously, the bag with the snake still in it was covering the man's head and part of his chest.\nThe paramedics handed the bag to another zoo employee, who delivered the snake to its new home. They then transported the handler to the city hospital. Later, a hospital spokesman said that the handler was in good condition. He said that viper bites can cause a lot of tissue damage in the immediate area of the bite if not treated properly and quickly, but it looked like this victim would recover completely.\nThe zoo director said that this particular adder had a nasty reputation. This was the third time in six years that it had managed to bite someone. Fortunately, the previous two victims also recovered fully. In the future, the director joked, they might call the bomb disposal unit to handle the snake."

        "grade": 7.2,
        "text": "Mid‐December through mid‐March is often rainy and chilly. It's jacket and umbrella time. Rain excites the local TV weather people. They get to remind viewers, in their best parental voice, to \"remember your umbrellas, watch out for traffic, and drive carefully!\" Pity the poor people who don't watch TV. They probably forget their umbrellas, walk into traffic, and crash their cars every rainstorm. Another expression weather persons wear out during the rainy season is \"Storm warning!\" They love to say that, even though it rhymes less than \"June gloom.\" Sometimes, however, no storm follows the storm warning. You don't have to watch TV news for long in winter to realize that the weather people are like the boy who cried \"Wolf!\"\nWhen a big storm hits LA, every TV station sends at least one reporter out into the streets. The reporter stands in the street near the biggest puddle he can find. The raindrops hit the puddle. The camera zooms in on the raindrops hitting the puddle. The camera zooms in on vehicles' back‐and‐forth windshield wipers. The camera zooms in on people holding umbrellas or folded newspapers over their heads. Another reporter is sent to a nearby stream. The camera zooms in on the raindrops hitting the barely flowing stream and on the reporter's feet as he stands ankle‐deep in the stream. Two hours later, he is still standing only ankle‐deep in the stream, but the camera zooms in anyway. The mild‐mannered stream hasn't become the angry river that the TV station producers had hoped to bring you. But, there'll always be more storms. Hopefully, that reporter used an old pair of shoes and didn't catch a cold.\nLocal TV weather persons do their best to make weather, which is boringly predictable 90 percent of the time in LA, interesting. Not only do they fail 90 percent of the time but also, aside from NBC's Fritz, who wryly presents the weather and never displays the slightest bit of excitement, they make themselves look a little silly."

Her long distance phone bill was one expense that sprang to mind. She was paying almost $30 a month to Horizon, her local phone company. That $30 covered her residence line and various taxes, surcharges, funds, fees, and services. It also covered her local phone calls—those to locations within 12 miles.\nBut she was paying another $40‐$80 a month talking to her best friend and to her boyfriend, both of whom lived more than 12 miles away from her. But how could she not talk to her best friend and to her boyfriend? Could she tell them she was having budget problems, so could they please call her in the future? Could she just call them less often—a lot less often?\nFortunately for Debra, she found the solution a month later, when she tearfully discovered that her boyfriend and her best friend were seeing each other behind Debra's back. Debra saw them kissing in his car outside of a restaurant that all three of them liked to visit occasionally. Debra immediately called Horizon to cancel her long distance service. The female customer service representative asked if she was sure she wanted to do this. Debra said, \"Yes, I'm sure. All men are jerks.\" The representative agreed enthusiastically with her.\nDebra was only on her new computer for a week before she discovered Computer Dating, a service that promised: \"Ladies, you will get to choose from hundreds of men in your own ZIP code area. New selections every day. Only $29.95 a month!\" As much as she hated her ex‐boyfriend, Debra knew that not all men were alike. Maybe Mr. Right was waiting for her on her computer screen. Maybe he was living only a block away. And she did happen to have $30 available."

Woody Harrelson, 24, who had a house key, had hidden in the closet of the Shatner family's home waiting for his ex‐girlfriend Ethel, 23, to return. He attacked Ethel with a knife seconds after she arrived home. She was carrying their 11‐month‐old baby in her arms. Woody stabbed away, not caring if he injured his baby or not. Ethel, bleeding and screaming, ran into her bedroom and put the baby into the crib. Woody followed her into the bedroom.\nCurt ran into the bedroom and jumped onto Woody's back. From behind, he managed to jam his fingers into Woody's eyes. Woody yelled and dropped the knife. As Woody stumbled around rubbing his eyes, Curt grabbed the knife and plunged it twice into Woody's lower back. Woody ran out of the house. Curt held onto the knife in case Woody came back. Ethel called 911. The paramedics treated Ethel's wounds and transported her to the hospital, where she is in stable condition. The baby, protected by its heavy clothing and a blanket, was unharmed. Woody has not been caught yet.\nAll hospitals in the area were alerted to watch for Woody, because Curt said that he \"got him good.\" In fact, said one doctor, Woody should get to a hospital as soon as possible. He might bleed to death if Curt actually punctured one of Woody's kidneys. The paramedics and police commended little Curt for his bravery. He said that it was his responsibility to protect his sister, because \"When Daddy's not home, I'm the man of the family.\"",

The average price for 87 octane economy gas is $2.22, almost 30 percent higher today than it was 12 months ago. The lowest gas price in the Southland right now is $2.09 a gallon at the Seashell station in Arcadia. The station manager, Everett, said the reason his gas is cheaper than elsewhere is that he bought a lot of gas two years ago at reduced prices, so he is passing his savings on to his customers.\nThe lines at the Seashell station often run 10 to 20 vehicles long. The police have been there several times because cars block traffic on Horsetrail Drive. Everett said, \"I tell people in line that the Barco station a block away is only $2.14, but they'd rather wait and save 5 cents. It's okay with me, of course. I don't mind making money.\"\nA young man pumping gas said he had waited in line for 20 minutes. When asked why he didn't go a block away where there were no lines, he said, \"Every penny counts. When I bought this '99 Bummer, gas was only $1 a gallon, which was pretty cheap. So, even though I only get eight miles per gallon, I wasn't paying that much to fill my tank. But today's prices are killing me. I drive to work, and I drive to the grocery store. That's it. I used to drive around the neighborhood just to show off my wheels, but I can't do that anymore.\"",

Intelligent design, the parents argue, is false science. It is simply a clever phrase for creationism. Creationism is based on the Book of Genesis in the Bible. It is the belief that, in six days, God created the universe and all its creatures, including Adam and Eve, the first humans.\nSchool district officials believe that evolution is merely a theory, and a flawed one at that. They argue that, if students taking biology must learn about evolution, these students must also learn about intelligent design.\n\"There are two sides to every story,\" said Daryl Scopes, a district official. \"Darwin's theory of evolution is just that—a theory. Not one scientist has ever proved that it is valid. The whole idea is absurd. Darwin wants us to believe that all Earth's animals, from ants to elephants, have one common ancestor—the sponge! How ridiculous is that?! Who would worship a sponge?! We decided that our students must be aware of the true facts, as described in Genesis. God created the first man—Adam—in His own image. From one of Adam's ribs, God then created Eve. God put Adam and Eve in charge of the Earth and all its creatures. Adam and Eve were perfect humans. But then they listened to the evil serpent and ate the forbidden fruit, and life for them—and us, their children—has been far from perfect ever since. That's a beautiful story that we all learned as children. But, even more important, it's a completely true story.\" 7.0, 278"

He thought about the pile of statements, receipts, and other papers in his apartment that he hadn't organized in months.\nNevertheless, he decided to go to the interview. He had taken computerized exams for several other New York City agencies. Even though he had passed those exams, he had not received invitations to job interviews yet. He figured he would accept this particular opportunity and see how it played out. But the first chance he got to jump ship to another interview and another job, he would jump.\nHe went to the interview. Two workers asked him about a dozen questions and marked down how he answered each question. He was in a room where three other applicants were also being asked the same questions by other workers at other tables. Sometimes he was able to listen to other answers. He used a couple of those answers for his own answers.\nThe final question was, \"Why do you want this job?\" In truth, of course, he wanted it because he was unemployed and he would take just about any job that he could get. Instead, he said, \"My parents would be very proud of me to be an agency employee. Plus, this job would enable me to 'give back' to my community, and it would make my life meaningful, purposeful, and fulfilling.\" He was proud of his response."

Who ever heard of a Thursday wedding? \"Well,\" Harlan explained to everyone, \"the Thursday event is going to cost me half of what Friday, Saturday, or Sunday would cost me. And a 50‐percent discount is a lot of money, believe me.\" Everyone believed him. Harlan knew how to count his pennies. The early evening event was at Cowfish, a popular restaurant and meeting place on campus.\nNevin and Janelle arrived at 5 p.m. for pictures, but the photographer had been delayed on the freeway because someone had jumped off an overpass. So they decided to take a stroll on campus. Walking westward, they soon found a fish pond. About a dozen small turtles were swimming in the eastern end of the pond. As Janelle kneeled at water's edge, all the turtles swam toward her. A couple of them climbed out of the water and onto the footpath. They wanted food, but a sign advised visitors not to feed the fish or turtles. So she apologized to the turtles—not that she had \"any turtle food anyway,\" she added. Nevin and Janelle took pictures of themselves and the turtles.\nThey walked back to Cowfish just before the ceremony was to begin. Some of the preacher's words were unclear because of static on the portable microphone. After the preacher pronounced Harlan and Ellen husband and wife, guests clapped and cheered. The photographer, who had gotten \"some great pictures\" of the fallen body, busily took pictures of the bride and groom, the preacher, the parents, and the guests.\nAfter their meal, Nevin and Janelle said good night to the newly married couple. This was the fourth marriage for Harlan, so everyone was hoping it would be his last. Then Nevin and Janelle walked out to their car, holding hands and talking about what would be the same and what would be different at their own wedding. That is, if they didn't decide to just drive to Las Vegas for a quick marriage, with Elvis performing at their ceremony.\n\"That way, our only difficult decision will be to pick which song he will sing for us,\" Janelle said.",

The Santa Ana winds were howling that day, and his carelessness resulted in the Witch fire. That fire destroyed 18,000 acres of woodland and 12 homes. The total damage and the cost of firefighting efforts were estimated at $25 million. Ironically, his parents' house was untouched by the fire.\nThe authorities did not immediately announce what they would do to the boy or his parents. An official in the district attorney's office said that, probably, no criminal charges would be filed. But the parents would still be liable for civil charges. That is, victims could sue for their losses and rebuilding costs. Suing the middle‐class family for millions would be the easy part, though; collecting the millions would be unlikely.\nHomeowners disagreed on what should be done. \"I don't have a house anymore,\" said John Ritter. \"It will take at least two years to build a new house, and my insurance is only going to pay about half the cost of the new house. Ordinarily, I would say that the boy and his parents ought to be put in jail for at least 10 years. But because their house didn't burn down, I think the law should just allow me to trade property with them. They can have my burned‐down house, and I can move into their house. That's fair enough for me.\"\n\"We all make mistakes, especially when we're young,\" said Michael Richards, another homeowner whose house burned down. \"I remember setting my sister on fire when I was about 10. I didn't mean to do it, of course, and she jumped into the lake, so she was okay. But it could have been a terrible accident. I think the poor boy has learned a valuable lesson.

        "text": "Charles, a 29‐year‐old painter, tried to beat an 83‐car freight train across the railroad tracks yesterday and lost. Fortunately for Charles and his two friends, the train hit the bed of his pickup truck. The force of the impact separated the rear of the truck from the front. The rear end of the pickup flew about 200 feet west of the front end. The train was traveling at 50 miles an hour through an industrial district. It was fully loaded with appliances and new vehicles from the east coast. There were no mechanical arms or flashing lights at the railroad crossing—only a stop sign on either side of the two‐lane road.\nThe accident occurred at 4:30 p.m. on a sunny afternoon. Charles and his two co‐workers had stopped at a neighborhood liquor store at about 3:45. There they had bought a case of bottled beer that was on sale for $9.95. By the time they got to the railroad crossing, they were all feeling good. They saw the train coming, and they heard the horn blowing.\nWhen the police arrived, all three friends were sitting on the ground under a shade tree about 50 feet from the front end of the truck. None of them were even scratched. The train and crew suffered no damage or injuries.\n\"I was going to stop,\" said Charles. \"But Tommy told me that the train wasn't even close. He said that if he was driving, he could drive over the tracks, make a U‐turn, drive over the tracks again, and then drink a whole beer before the train arrived.\"\nThe engineer just shook his head.\n\"They think it's exciting, but it's just stupid,\" the engineer said. \"These guys might be in jail for a little while. But I guarantee you, within a year they'll be out drinking and driving and racing trains again.\"\nThe police charged Charles with driving under the influence, running a stop sign, causing an accident, reckless endangerment, and littering—broken beer bottles were all over the place. They charged his two friends with drinking in a moving vehicle and littering.\nA city official said there are no plans to install flashing lights and mechanical arms at the crossing, partly because not enough accidents occur there and partly because the city does not have sufficient funds to pay for such safety equipment."

At this time, you pay half the amount ($25,000). A cultured cell is implanted into a female cat that is in estrus, and, if all goes well, a kitten is born about 60 days later. The new kitten is weaned in about eight weeks. TwIN, Inc. delivers the kitten to you after it receives the remaining $25,000.\n\"We are a growing company,\" said Lee. \"Our facility can handle about a dozen births a year now, but our goal is to produce about 50 kittens and 50 puppies a year.\" The company is currently experimenting with stray dogs.

Even as you dream peacefully with your head on your pillow, bedbugs might be nibbling away at you. During the day, they relax inside pillows and mattresses, waiting for your evening arrival so they can enjoy their nocturnal bedtime snack—which is you! But bedbugs don't kill people. An insect that does kill people is the mosquito, the deadliest insect in the world. Its malarial bite kills a couple of million people every year. Other insects, like bees and wasps, kill about 60 people in the United States every year.\nWalk outside and you are a target for \"man's best friend.\" Dogs bite about four million Americans every year. About 100 dog‐bite victims visit U.S. emergency rooms every day. Many bites are terrible. A vicious attack on a young woman in France led to the first face transplant. To avoid the dogs near or on the sidewalks in your neighborhood, you might want to hike into the desert or the woods. There, you run the risk of bites from rattlesnakes, scorpions, and blood‐sucking ticks. Not to mention the occasional bear, wolf, or mountain lion.\nSafely back at home, watch where you go in your house or garage. Shy but deadly, the black widow spider and the brown recluse spider make themselves comfortable in quiet areas of your closets or garage. One bite from either of them can make you very sick; about six Americans die every year from such bites.\nAnother bite to worry about is a rabid animal bite. Any warm‐blooded animal can get infected with rabies. Rabies is a virus, like Ebola, but more of a killer than Ebola. Rabies kills about 50,000 people worldwide annually. In the U.S., about 20,000 people get treated for rabies annually, but only one or two persons die. Many people get rabies from their cats, which in turn got rabies from a wild animal. Make sure you take your pets to the vet to get rabies vaccinations. Those shots will save their lives—and maybe yours!\nAnd the next time you take a bite out of something, like a crisp, juicy Fuji apple, remember that something, somewhere, sometime is waiting to take a bite out of you! 6.8, 402"

There has been no rain for two months, and the trees are so dry that just the heat from an approaching fire causes them to explode into flames.\nPolice have arrested three suspected arsonists. One suspect, oddly enough, was still complaining about the 2004 Olympics. He had applied to carry the torch into the stadium and light the fire to officially start the Games. His application was ignored. \"You have to be somebody,\" was the reply he got when he called the Olympic Committee in Athens. \"And you're not—you're nobody,\" an official told him. The man was in jail for three years for trying to blow up the committee's headquarters. Yesterday, police caught him walking away from a new fire with an empty gas can in his hands.\n\"I'm nobody, huh?\" he told the police. \"Well, I'm somebody now!\"",

He told the five workers to go about their business, but he ordered them not to try to leave. \"If one of you tries to leave,\" he said, \"I will kill myself along with the others.\" Then he walked over to a desk and asked for Hillary's phone number. Hillary was in Iowa, talking to voters about her plan to provide national health care for everyone in America.\nNone of the workers had her cell phone number. Upset, Morgan dialed 911. He told the dispatcher that if they didn't give him Hillary's phone number immediately, he would blow up her campaign office and everyone in it. The dispatcher asked him to please hold on while he tried to get the number. Police and the FBI drove over to the office and surrounded it.\nThe dispatcher gave Morgan the correct phone number. He dialed it, and Hillary answered her phone. Morgan explained to her that he was not getting the medical treatment that he needed. Every time he went to visit his doctor, his doctor was out to lunch, even at 10 in the morning and 4 in the afternoon. \"How can my doctor eat lunch all day long?\" he asked Hillary. Hillary said she didn't know, but that she would try to get a law passed forbidding doctors to have all‐day lunches.\nMorgan continued talking to Hillary until he noticed the police car lights outside the building. He hung up and walked to the front door of the building. A police captain asked Morgan to release all the hostages. Morgan said he would release them if the police brought him a cigarette and a Whopper from Burger King. A short while later, while Morgan was eating the Whopper, the police rushed in and tackled him. His \"bomb\" was nothing more than a few flares taped to his waist under his jacket.\nMorgan, who lived in a nearby town, was known for his strange behavior. He had been under psychiatric care for much of his life. FBI officials were outraged that Morgan had interrupted a busy presidential candidate. A spokesman vowed that Morgan would be thrown into jail for a long time for kidnapping, reckless endangerment, and terrorism. \"Mental illness is no excuse,\" he declared. \"This is a nation of laws, not excuses.\"",

        "text": "A classical guitarist was thrilled to hear from New York City police that his valuable guitar had been found. It disappeared almost a year ago when he got out of a taxicab and forgot to take the guitar with him. Laurence Lennon, 44, said he was running late that day. He was talking to his manager on his cell phone when he dashed out of the cab. He said that he gave the driver $60 and told him to keep the change. He walked through the front doors of the concert hall still talking on the phone to his manager.\nUpon discovering his loss, Lennon used his cell phone to call the police. The policewoman asked him for the name of the cab company, the number of the cab, and the name of the driver. He said that she had to be kidding.\nShe told Lennon that he could file a missing items report at the police station or online. Lennon asked for the online address. It was www.nypd.gov‐toprotect‐andtoserve‐havea‐niceday. She told him that finding the guitar might take a couple of years—finding guitars was not as important as finding murderers and marijuana smokers. Then she told him to have a nice day.\n\"This year has been depressing,\" said Lennon. \"I had to postpone the recording of two new CDs. I've been using borrowed guitars. And I was losing hope of ever recovering my guitar.\"\nLennon was reunited with his $100,000 guitar yesterday. The case and the guitar had been discovered in the corner of a coffeehouse only two blocks from where Lennon had lost it in the first place. Lennon had offered a $10,000 reward for its return. He said he would give the reward to the coffeehouse owner, who had notified the police. The police department prepared a news release about its success in tracking down the guitar.",

It passed a new ordinance: the owner of a dog that barks for 30 minutes straight will get a warning the first time a complaint is made. For a second complaint, the owner will pay a $100 fine or go to jail for a week maximum, or both. The council wrote no penalty concerning a third or fourth complaint. \"Finally,\" said Zev Doheny, \"we've passed a noise law with some teeth in it.\"\nOf course, there are a few problems with the new law: How does a resident prove that a dog was barking for 30 minutes?

Couldn't a person tape just any old dog barking and then claim that it's his neighbor's dog doing all that barking? Do dogs have voiceprints, like humans have fingerprints? Will all dogs have to get \"voiceprinted?\"\n\"There isn't one brain among the lot of them,\" complained the owner of a pet store when he heard about the council's new law. \"Their 'solutions' are almost always worse than the problems themselves.\"",

Only two days to go.\nWednesday afternoon, his friend Gil called, asking Archie if he wanted to play golf the next morning. Archie said he was on jury duty that week.\nGil said, \"Well, no problem! It's already Wednesday. You've made it! There's no way that they're going to call you to jury duty this late in the week.\"\nArchie couldn't believe that Gil had said that. Archie knocked several times on his wooden bookcase, saying that he hoped that Gil was right.\nAt 5:05 that evening, still worried that Gil had jinxed him, Archie dialed the 800 number. Sure enough, the recording told him to call back Thursday between noon and 12:30, instead of the usual 5 p.m. Blast that Gil, Archie thought.\nThursday, he anxiously called at 12:28. The recording told him that his jury service was finished! All he had to do was mail in the affidavit that had come in the white envelope. Archie put the affidavit into an envelope, put a 41‐cent first‐class stamp on the envelope, and drove to the post office. Whistling as he dropped the envelope into the mailbox, he happily washed his hands once again of the \"privilege\" of doing jury service.",

Fifty others left because the lines were moving so slowly. The event concluded at 6 p.m., three hours after the scheduled close. It was a long day for everyone—administrators, nurses, and donors. But there were plenty of chairs and tables, and many people brought their own books, magazines, or newspapers.\nThe first thing the donors had to do, of course, was fill out the donor registration and screening form. When they finished filling out the form, they waited until a nurse called them to her desk. The average adult body contains 8 to 12 pints of blood. Donors can give one pint at a time. It takes one's body 2 to 4 weeks to replace this amount. Most donors filled up the pint bag within 5 to 10 minutes.\nBefore leaving, the donors received a sheet of instructions including: Do not lift any heavy objects for 12 hours. Leave your pressure bandage on for 2 to 3 hours. Do not smoke for at least 30 minutes. Avoid alcohol for the rest of the day. Do not do any strenuous activity for 24 hours.\n\"I wish I could hug and kiss all the volunteers that are here today,\" said Martha, the blood center donor recruiter. \"Many donors underestimate the importance of what they're doing. They think it is no big deal, but it is a big deal. Their blood is actually saving lives, helping other people to live. We cannot thank them enough for that, nor can the recipients.\"",

He used to take vacations with Matt, his youngest brother, but they had a big argument at the end of their last vacation. Each of them had spent the last three years waiting for the other to apologize.\nKevin did not feel good about being on non‐speaking terms with his favorite brother. But he was not going to ask for forgiveness when, in his mind, this whole misunderstanding was his brother's fault.\nSo Kevin's summer vacation was spent in his own \"back yard.\" As usual, he had planned to clean up his apartment. As usual, two weeks later his apartment looked just as it had two weeks before.\nHe did do one thing new and different during his vacation. He went to a new coffee shop, called Peet's, on Foothill Boulevard. It served 25 varieties of delicious coffee at reasonable prices, and the staff were genuinely friendly.\nThe coffee shop had a do‐it‐yourself counter near the entrance. On the counter were lids, straws, and wooden stirrers. There were wraps to protect your hand from the hot coffee inside the cup. There were also individual servings of sugar, sweeteners, and creamers. Kevin used the lids and wraps, but drank his coffee black.\nThe shop was air‐conditioned at a slightly chilly temperature. About eight small, round tables were inside. Outside were four bigger tables. Each had four white metal chairs around it, and several big umbrellas provided shade. Even on hot afternoons, there was usually a pleasant breeze.\nKevin visited the coffee shop four times during his vacation. He always sat at a table outside by himself and read the free daily paper. Each day he was there, he read most of the newspaper articles while he enjoyed two cups of coffee.\nBetween articles, he took breaks by watching the nearby traffic and pedestrians. The coffee shop was next to a huge parking lot. The lot was for customers of Ralphs, BlockBuster, Bank of America, Baja Fresh, See's Candies, and several other stores. Kevin considered his outdoor seat the perfect place for one of his favorite activities—people‐watching.\nThe coffee shop, with its excellent location and coffee, had helped make his vacation a pleasant one. But he knew in his heart, had his brother been there to join him just one day, his vacation would have been a perfect one."

Even many hearty people hardly notice their hardy hearts!\nYour heart beats 60 times a minute, or 3,600 times an hour. What physical thing can most of us do 3,600 times in one hour? Blink? Maybe, but after a while we'd probably get tired of or bored with the constant blinking. Tap our fingers on the desk? Nope. Jump up and down? Certainly not!\nBut your heart keeps beating, minute after minute, hour after hour. Every day, it pumps almost 2,000 gallons of blood through our blood vessels. The average bathtub can hold about 50 gallons of water (filled to the top without anyone sitting in the tub). So, your heart pumps about 40 bathtubs of blood every day. Unbelievable. Give your heart a pat on the back!\nAnd, unlike your head or your feet or your back, your heart does all this work without ever complaining! You never know that it's even there. Your heart is such a reliable \"silent partner\" that people forget to care for it. For many people, the first indication that their heart isn't functioning properly is death—a fatal heart attack! Over 650,000 Americans die annually of some kind of heart disease. Our hearts keep us alive, but they're also our number one killer. Cancer kills 560,000, stroke kills 143,000, and accidents kill 118,000 Americans annually.\nLike accidental deaths, many heart disease‐related deaths can be avoided if people simply follow the advice of health practitioners. Unfortunately, many people seem to listen to a little voice in their head that says, \"It won't happen to me.\" So these people keep on smoking and drinking. They keep on eating salty snacks and fatty meat. And they keep on \"exercising\" by getting off the sofa, walking to the fridge, and grabbing another sugar‐filled soda."

All trainees received two huge notebook binders, each containing about 600 pages. At the end of the first week, he promised himself that he would not be the first to drop out. Every day, the instructors presented more rules and regulations that students had to understand and memorize. All the students busily highlighted various sentences in various colors in their notebooks.\nSome rules and regs seemed to him to contradict one another. He constantly raised his hand to ask questions. Several times he asked classmates, \"Do you understand all this stuff?\" Most of them admitted they didn't. He not only didn't understand many of the rules and regs, but also couldn't remember one from another. Despite his studying, they were all jumbled together in his mind.\nOn Friday of week seven, even though no one else had dropped out, he told the lead instructor, \"I'm finished.

The last such strike, in 1988, cost the industry half a billion dollars. That strike lasted five months. Such a strike affects everyone in the business, from TV and movie industry executives all the way down to the people selling popcorn at local movie theaters.\nAll movies currently in production that require the skills of active writers will halt production. TV networks will substitute new game shows and \"reality\" shows that don't require professional writers. In addition, of course, there will be plenty of reruns. TV viewers in search of fresh programs might have to switch to cable TV or rent DVDs. A recent nationwide poll indicates that the general public strongly supports the writers, who are thought to be underpaid and unappreciated.\n\"Writers are too demanding,\" complained Reese Majors, vice president of CEC Entertainment, a production company with seven shows airing weekly on network TV. \"They think they are so special. All they do is type a bunch of words onto a piece of paper. My six‐year‐old can do that. They claim that writing is work. But how can it be work when it is done in the comfort of their homes? How can you call sitting at home 'work'? The actors and the crew have to go on location, where they must battle the cold, the heat, the jet lag, and the loneliness of being away from home.

But this was much bigger: it was $120,000! He had won the Big Cube, a state lottery game. To win, a contestant must first guess which number a spinning cube will stop on. The cube has six numbers on it: 1X, 10X, 50X, 100X, 500X, and 1000X. If he is correct, the contestant must then guess which of two selected variables is going to be greater. So, just guessing which number appears on the cube does not guarantee that he will win any money.\nSam correctly guessed 1000X, but he still had to choose between two variables. One variable was the number of cars that would run the stop sign at Hill Street and Lake Avenue in six hours. The other variable was the number of times that a teenage boy would change TV channels in a three‐hour period. This was a tough decision.\nFinally, Sam flipped a coin. It came up heads, so Sam picked the teenager. He picked right. The stop sign was run only 76 times, but the teen clicked 120 times. Sixty‐year‐old Sam jumped for joy, for he had just won 1000 times 120, or $120,000. Sam dreamily left the lottery studio. Talking excitedly on his cell phone while crossing the street, he got hit by a little sports car.\nSam is slowly getting better. He was in the hospital for a month. His hospital bill was $110,000. And the insurance company for the little sports car's owner sued Sam for $9,000 worth of repairs. Also, Sam still has to pay federal taxes on his winnings. Sam doesn't play the state lottery anymore. He says it's better to be unlucky.",

But the parade wouldn't start until 10 o'clock. His mom Julia tried to keep Jeffrey in check. She made him clean his room and take the dog for a walk. When he finished those chores, she walked with him to the parade route, which extended about two miles along Sierra Madre Boulevard.\nThe parade, as usual, was wonderful. It started with the high school band and a marching drum band. Then followed about a dozen government dignitaries in convertibles, smiling and waving at the people they were usually lying to. After that, there were clowns, jugglers, exotic cars, racing cars, and classic cars. Interwoven among the cars were Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, students representing various elementary schools, the local mountain rescue squad, and local realtors throwing out free candy with their business cards attached.\nThree bands played music from their rolling truck beds. The parade contained more than 500 participants and lasted two hours. Flags, balloons, and trash receptacles were everywhere. The sidewalks were full of spectators. Leashed to their owners, about 200 dogs also attended the parade, most of them sniffing, barking at, and playing with one another.\nThe final part of the parade was the fire trucks, blowing their horns and spraying all the kids who ran out into the street yelling and laughing. Jeffrey ran out with about 20 other kids and got totally wet. His shirt clung to his body. Water was squishing out of his shoes when he finally came back to the sidewalk. A huge smile was on his face.\n\"That was great, Mom!\" he exclaimed. \"Did you see that? When I grow up, I'm going to be a fireman.\" 6.5, 311"

        "text": "What a wonderful fruit the banana is, popular all over the world. Its three colors tell you how ripe it is. Green means go, as in go find another banana. Yellow means eat me. Brown means eat me but don't bother chewing before you swallow. The only thing that would make a banana more user‐friendly is if you could eat the peel. Plus, a banana is neat to eat. When you bite into it, you don't have to worry about juice squirting all over yourself and your dinner neighbors (like oranges or grapefruit, for example). And it's a silent food. You can chew it all you like without driving your neighbors crazy with crunching sounds (like apples or carrots, for example). Finally, it's easy to cut.  You don't need a steak knife; you can slice it with a fork or a spoon, if you like.\nYou're never too young or too old to eat bananas. Babies eat mashed bananas before their teeth grow in. Great‐great‐grandparents eat mashed bananas after their teeth fall out.\nThe banana is versatile. You can fry it, bake it, mash it, or eat it raw. You can slice it and put it on your breakfast cereal. At lunchtime you can snack on a raw banana, or make a peanut butter and banana sandwich, or eat a bag of dried bananas. You can add a banana to your ice cream for dessert and call it a banana split. You can order a healthful banana smoothie at your local smoothie store. On weekends you can order a banana daiquiri at your local bar or restaurant.\nHere in the U.S., we get most of our bananas from Ecuador and Costa Rica, although the fruit reportedly originated in Asia. Bananas give us lots of potassium and vitamins A and C, and hardly any sodium. The price of bananas hasn't changed much over recent years—they're still about 65 cents a pound, despite rising gas and labor prices. If that's too expensive, you can still get three pounds for a buck at many dollar stores.",

How high can they go?, is the question on everyone's lips. \"As long as interest rates stay around 5 percent, there's no telling,\" remarked one Realtor in Santa Monica, California.\n\"It's crazy,\" said Tim, who is looking for a house near the beach. \"In 1993, I bought my first place, a two‐bedroom condominium in Venice, for $70,000. My friends thought then that I was overpaying. Five years later, I had to move. I sold it for $230,000, which was a nice profit. Last year, while visiting friends here, I saw in the local paper that the exact same condo was for sale for $510,000!\"\nIt is a seller's market. Homebuyers feel like they have to offer at least 10 percent more than the asking price. Donna, a new owner of a one‐bedroom condo in Venice Beach, said, \"That's what I did. I told the owner that whatever anyone offers you, I'll give you $20,000 more, under the table, so you don't have to pay your Realtor any of it. I was tired of looking.\"\nTim says he hopes he doesn't get that desperate. \"Whether you decide to buy or decide not to buy, you still feel like you made the wrong decision. If you buy, you feel like you overpaid. If you don't buy, you want to kick yourself for passing up a great opportunity.\"\nEveryone says the bubble has to burst sometime, but everyone hopes it will burst the day after they sell their house. Even government officials have no idea what the future will bring. \"All we can say is that, inevitably, these things go in cycles,\" said the state director of housing. \"What goes up must come down. But, as we all know, housing prices always stay up a little higher than they go down. So you can't lose over the long run. Twenty years down the road, your house is always worth more than you paid for it.\"",

That sufficed for Dave. He went mostly because it was a social event with a few friends, not so much to catch fish. Even by itself, the scenic drive up a twisty, two‐lane road was worth the trip. Not to mention the big, beautiful houses and trees that lined the shore of the lake.\nPacking was a project in itself. Dave had even created a computer file named Fishing Trip. It was a checklist of 45 things to take to Big Bear. He took two rods, because on Free Fishing Day you were allowed to fish with two rods instead of the usual one rod. He took a hooded sweatshirt, jeans, two pair of socks, a heavy, hooded denim jacket, winter gloves, and a scarf. He also took flip‐flops, shorts, a T‐shirt, No. 30 sun block, sunglasses, a big hat, and a lightweight raincoat. If you go to Big Bear in June, you'd better be prepared for hot or cold, rain or shine.\nHe packed a couple of magazines to read just in case the fish weren't biting. He and his friends joked that the fish were always biting in the spot you just left or the spot you were headed to.\nAfter about an hour and a half, Dave had gathered all the items on his list into a neat pile next to his door. He went to bed knowing that Big Bear's weather and fishing were unpredictable, but the good time with his friends was a given.",

        "text": "Many Americans don't understand the food labels, or Nutrition Facts, on the packages of their processed foods. The labels contain important information about what's in the food, including the amount of salt, which is a very popular additive. Even though health practitioners and the federal government itself tell consumers to watch their salt intake, processors continue to add salt to packaged food.\nSalt occurs naturally in many foods. For example, raisins, as sweet as they are, contain the tiniest bit of salt. For many other foods that may already contain salt naturally, processors add more. Why? For some foods, particularly meat, salt works as a preservative.\nFor some foods, salt is added to increase thirst. Many bars offer free pretzels and peanuts to their patrons. The salty pretzels and peanuts increase the patrons' thirst. They order another drink. And another. The pretzels and peanuts aren't really free; they're part of the cost of the drinks.\nThe most common reason to add salt is simply to add flavor to the food so that consumers buy it again. Consumers select many packaged foods with added salt while shopping in their supermarket. Parents often bring their kids along while shopping. Kids think shopping is fun, but parents can also make shopping a learning experience, as in the following dialogue between a mother and her son.\n\"Read the Nutrition Facts label to see how much salt is in this box of chicken noodle soup.\"\n\"Mom, there's no salt at all in this soup.\"\n\"Yes, there is. Just look where it says 'sodium'—that's another name for salt.\"\n\"Oh, okay. Why doesn't it just say 'salt'? It says 'Sodium, 800 mg, 33%.' I know what milligrams are, but what does 33% mean?\" 6.4, 288"

That store will receive one percent of the prize, or $180,000. The owner of the store, Mark Abrams, 56, was overjoyed. \"Last year we had a storm that blew half of our roof off. It cost $25,000 to put a new roof on.\"\nHayes said he was reminded to check his numbers when he heard that a woman had lost her winning ticket. He and his wife had been camping in the mountains when the winning number was drawn.\n\"But I feel sorry for this woman,\" said Hayes. \"She only did this out of desperation. In fact, I'm going to help her out financially whether she goes to prison or not. It's a shame that this wealthy country has so many poor people. Also, I'm going to donate a lot of this money to different charities. What do I need $18 million for?\"\nThe checks to Hayes and Abrams should arrive within two weeks, according to a lottery spokesman. The spokesman mentioned that lottery players should remember that the odds of winning the lottery are only about one in forty million. Even so, most people think that someone has to win, and it might as well be them.",

        "text": "Ed came home from his errands and put the groceries into the cupboard and the refrigerator. He grabbed a flathead screwdriver and a pair of pliers from his toolbox. In the kitchen, he got down on his hands and knees and turned on the flashlight. After a couple of minutes of looking, he decided what to do. He had never opened up a disposal before, but there is a first time for everything.\nThe cylindrical disposal was about 7 inches in diameter and had a horizontal seam dividing the top half from the bottom half. The halves were held together by three screws. Ed jiggled the bottom half of the disposal; it was loose because two of the three screws were corroded. Only one screw was still doing its duty. Ed unscrewed it.\nThe bottom half of the disposal was now lying on the cabinet floor. Ed thought for sure that it would be full of months‐old food, but there was no food—only a hardened, torn, useless gasket. The next day Ed went to the hardware store to buy some screws and a new gasket. The employee told him that they did not carry those gaskets and suggested that he write to the manufacturer. Ed returned home. He created his own gasket by using gasket sealant that comes in a tube. He applied the sealant, screwed the two halves back together, and crossed his fingers.\nThe next day he turned on the water and switched on the disposal. When he saw the water pouring out of the seam, Ed knew one thing: it was time to buy a new disposal. The good thing was that new disposals started at $79. The bad thing was that it would have to be installed by a plumber. Plumber rates started at about $80 an hour. Ed decided that since the disposal used a lot of energy and the world needed to use less energy, from now on he would put his scraps into the kitchen garbage bag. He reminded himself to tell everyone at work tomorrow about how he was now helping to solve the world's energy problems.",

Clio has a population of 28,000, but it has at least 30 gangs. The gangs make most of their money from dealing drugs and offering \"protection.\" They also commit violent crimes, such as murder, battery, and rape.\nThere were 1,486 thefts last year. Most of the thefts involved cars. Thieves also robbed people at gunpoint or pickpocketed them. They broke into houses and businesses at the alarming rate of two a day two years ago, but that rate was down to only one a day last year. \"That's a 50‐percent decrease in one year,\" beamed Gates. \"I think the officers deserve a big pat on the back. Even better, maybe they'll get that 10‐percent raise that they are all hoping for next fiscal year.\"\nCiting an example of how the police force has helped reduce crime, Gates talked about bicycle thefts. \"For years and years, kids were locking up their bikes at bike stands in front of schools, libraries, and malls. About 10 percent of the time, the kids would come out of the school or wherever and discover that their bike was no longer there. Someone had cut the lock and stolen their bike. We wracked our brains trying to find a solution to this problem. Finally, at the beginning of last year, we hit upon it. We simply removed most of the bike stands. Then the bicycle theft rate came down quickly.\"\nMost cities in the state have similar problems. They all involve too many people, too much crime, too few police, and too little funding.

To land, they cut some of the cords attaching the balloons to the chair. A small group of daredevils has been enjoying this sport for more than 30 years.\nThey usually take a radio to communicate with people on the ground, a GPS device so they can be located, a parachute, and bags of sand or water that they throw overboard to go higher. \"It's fun, but it's not for everyone,\" said Glenn Ford. \"You have to dress warmly for higher altitudes. You should always take a life preserver and wear a helmet. And you need to take food and water for emergencies.\" Balloonists often soar up to 6,000 feet, and many have soared to 12,000 feet or higher.\nA popular priest in Brazil decided to try cluster ballooning. Reporters from newspapers and TV stations interviewed and photographed him before take‐off. He laughed and waved at everyone as his chair started rising. \"I'll see you at one o'clock,\" he yelled to everyone on the ground. It was 11 a.m.\nThe weather, however, took a sudden turn for the worse. People could see the wind driving the balloonist toward the Atlantic. The bright balloons disappeared into the dark clouds. The next day, a pilot in a single‐engine plane saw some balloons floating 10 miles out to sea. There was no sign of the priest.\n\"This is unbelievable,\" said his best friend. \"He was an expert sky diver. He had a life preserver, an inflatable life raft, and a GPS device.

It was their first visit to California, and they were excited.\nThey visited San Diego's world‐famous zoo and fell in love with the giant pandas. \"They are so cute,\" Erin said. Then they drove north to La Jolla so that they could glide off the cliffs 100 feet above the beach. That was scary, exciting, fun, and expensive. They went to a local beach to get a peek at nudists, but no one was there. \"That was a major disappointment,\" Erin joked.\nAfter shopping in La Jolla, they headed north to Los Angeles. They saw the Hollywood sign and visited many places in Hollywood and Beverly Hills. They hoped they would see lots of actors and actors' homes. If they got lucky, they would get some autographs and maybe even some photographs of them standing next to a movie star.\nBut they were disappointed. A minivan took them on a tour past actors' homes, but no actors were outside their homes. The homes themselves were barely visible. They were often hidden by tall gates, fences, walls, hedges, or trees. Later, however, Erin and Amy were able to put their hands and feet into the handprints and footprints of movie stars at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.\nThey went to Venice boardwalk just south of the Santa Monica pier, because the boardwalk is famous for its muscle beach, weird characters, and paddle tennis. The boardwalk is one of the best places in California for people‐watching. The girls enjoyed talking to the colorful locals. They were also surprised at how many people they talked to were Europeans visiting California.\nAfter Venice, they went sunbathing on the beach just north of the Venice pier. They even got to hang out with some real California surfers. The surfers tried to teach them how to ride a board in the water. That was difficult but fun. They took plenty of pictures to show their friends back home.\nErin and Amy drove to Burbank the next day to watch the taping of a Jay Leno show, but the line was so long that they decided to pass on it. Instead they went to a mall and had a great time shopping. They flew back to Georgia with souvenirs, photos, and wonderful memories. \"But next time,\" said Amy, \"We're not leaving until we see some real live actors!\" 6.2, 421"

All of them make an honest person's life more difficult.

        "text": "Easter Sunday was a cloudy but festive day in Memorial Park for about 100 kids from local orphanages. An Easter egg hunt started at 10 a.m., when a fire engine blasted its horn. Boys and girls, ranging in age from 2 to 6, dashed throughout the park, yelling and screaming, walking and running, and quite often falling down. One little girl, Amanda, found her first egg less than a minute after the horn blew. Instead of putting it into her basket and continuing to search for more, she sat down. Then she spent the next 10 minutes examining it, unwrapping it, and eating it piece by piece. When she finished, she put the wrapper into her basket, wiped her hands on her white dress, and went to hunt for another egg.\nMeanwhile, Jeff, one of the older boys, filled his basket to overflowing. He asked one of the firemen to hold it for him, and then took off running for more candy eggs. As soon as he found some, he put them into the basket of the child closest to him. Two little toddlers both saw a candy egg at the same time, and they both bent over to pick it up. They banged heads, and both of them sat down bawling. A couple of volunteer nurses picked them up and told them that everything was going to be all right.\nBy 11 a.m., the search was over. Most of the kids were studying their candy, exchanging it with others, or eating it. But then the fire engine horn blasted again, causing three‐year‐old Jenny to cry. A fireman on a bullhorn told everyone to gather around, because a special guest had arrived.\nOnce everyone was settled, the Easter Bunny climbed down out of the fire engine. The bunny was 6'6\" tall. Most of the kids cheered and ran toward him. Even Jenny stopped crying for a moment. She stared at the bunny and at all the kids running toward the bunny; then she started crying even harder. The Easter Bunny hugged the kids, and they hugged him. Then the Easter Bunny sat on a fire engine step, and one by one the kids came up, sat on his lap, and got their pictures taken. After that, the older kids were allowed to explore the fire engine itself.\nThe festivities ended about 3 p.m., when the orphans climbed into the buses for the return trip home. Most of them said they had a fun time. Six‐year‐old Sara asked, \"Can we do this every Sunday?\"\nAnd more than one boy asked, \"Can I drive the fire engine next time?\"",

        "text": "A 20‐unit apartment building burned for about an hour before firemen were able to extinguish the fire. It started in the attic at about 10:30 p.m. yesterday evening. The damage was estimated at $1.5 million. A fire department spokesman said the fire might have been set deliberately.\nA tenant, who had seen the blaze from outside the building, banged loudly on the doors of units inside the building. Occupants of 14 units were already in bed or preparing for bed. No one responded in the other five units because the tenants were not home. Those tenants who were home escaped with nothing more than the clothes on their backs, their pets, their cell phones, and their laptops.\nMany tenants went across the street to watch the fire from a safe distance. They were all hoping that their units would be spared. Some of their cats were so disturbed by the noise, crowds, flames, and smoke that their owners could not hold on to them.

So Dylan took the car to a paint shop and got it painted dark blue for only $200. He was very pleased with the new look.\nThe car stereo did not work. Joe told him that no girl wanted to be in a car without a good sound system. So Dylan bought a nice stereo and installed it himself. Months went by. One day, Dylan told Joe that no girl had ridden in his \"new\" car yet.\n\"That's because there are other problems,\" Joe told him.\n\"Like what?\"\n\"Well, you don't exactly have the world's best personality,\" Joe said. \"That's a little more important than a paint job.\" So Dylan told Joe he would ask a psychologist to give him a new personality.\nRecently, Dylan had a new problem—gasoline. He smelled gas after he started his car; he smelled it while driving the car. Was he driving a bomb? What if someone tossed out a cigarette near his car? Would it explode into a thousand pieces—pieces that included Dylan?\nThat night, he opened his car manual. It was a well‐thumbed book. He had a car problem at least once a month, and he was always looking up ways to fix the problems. He thought this might be a carburetor problem.\nThe next day, he took his toolbox out to his car. He opened the hood. He started up the car and looked all around the carburetor for a gas leak. He could smell the gas, but he couldn't find a liquid trail. After a few minutes, however, he found the source of the problem. It was the fuel line.\nAll right, he thought, all I have to do is buy a new line and install it. But it wasn't long before he realized that this was a job for a mechanic. So he got into his car, opened all the windows, and drove to the closest mechanic. The mechanic quoted Dylan a price of only $50. He told Dylan to come back in an hour.\nDylan walked down the street to the coffee shop and bought himself a cup of coffee. He read the paper, drank the coffee, and then walked back to the shop.\n\"We couldn't fix it,\" said the mechanic. \"The fuel line wasn't the problem; you need a new fuel pump.\"\n\"A new fuel pump? How much is that?\" Dylan asked.\n\"Parts and labor? I think it'll be about $200. We'll have to special‐order the pump. This car is so old that they might not even make pumps for it anymore. Do you want me to try to order it for you? You'll have to put the money up first, of course.\"\n\"Let me think about it. Here's the $50 I owe you. I'll give you a call when I decide what to do.\"\nBut Dylan had already decided what to do. He had bought his car for only $1,100, but had put over $3,000 into it since then. When he got home, he called the Car Donation Corporation. They would take the car off his hands for free. Enough was enough. It was time to let go.",

The newcomer was deaf, or seemed to be, because he played his stereo loud enough for the whole building to hear.\nEdward went downstairs and politely told the newcomer that his stereo was too loud. He asked the new tenant to turn the volume down and keep it down as long as he lived in the building. The tenant appeared surprised and embarrassed, and said, \"Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was that loud.\"\nEdward returned upstairs, feeling good, because he had taken a stand and politely let the newcomer know that loud music was not going to be tolerated. The next day all was quiet, and Edward continued to be pleased with himself. The following day, Edward thought it must be the Fourth of July, because it sounded like a marching band was playing on his street. Of course, it wasn't the Fourth of July, and it wasn't a marching band. It was the new neighbor, who was playing his music loud again.\nEdward was not one to repeat himself, feeling that each time he did, he merely diminished the value of his words. So, he did what he always did with offensive neighbors—namely, grin and bear it. Eventually, they would move away. Or he would.\nIn Los Angeles that summer, a woman had complained to her upstairs neighbor that he was playing his drums too loud and too often. The drummer repeatedly ignored her. He told her to stop whining. One day the woman walked upstairs and shot the drummer in the head. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison.\nThe drummer won't bother anyone anymore with his drums, but the woman probably wishes that she hadn't used her gun. There aren't many things worse than living in prison. Instead of using a gun, she could have moved to another apartment, or even to another building. For the next 20 years, the only place she'll be moving is to the bottom bunk or the top bunk."

The fan was on medium speed, because low speed was too low for his hot apartment. He dared not use high speed, because loose papers on the tabletop would start flapping or flying everywhere. The fan was far enough away to barely stir the papers, but close enough to cool him off.\nSuddenly, Derek's stomach growled loudly. He didn't feel all that hungry, but he decided that the \"squeaky wheel\" should get some grease. He went over to the refrigerator. Absent‐mindedly, he opened the freezer door. Inside the freezer were six empty ice cube trays.\nHe shut the freezer door and opened the refrigerator door. He scrutinized the shelves: milk, pickles, olives, butter, diet soda, an unopened jar of strawberry preserves that he must have bought two years ago, ketchup, mustard, three bottles of water, a few pieces of hard candy, and some single‐wrap cheese slices. How could a whole refrigerator have nothing worth eating, Derek wondered. He opened the vegetable bins. Nothing was in there except some red onions, half a head of green cabbage, and two apples that had soft, brown spots.\nHis refrigerator contained some food, but it was food that didn't look the least bit appetizing. Only if he were really starving would he eat any of it. He thought of the C‐rations he used to eat in the army. Only when he was almost starving did he open his C‐rations. Then he wolfed all the food down and enjoyed a smoke afterwards.\nDerek went back to his desk and resumed using his computer and listening to the radio. His stomach growled again, but he ignored it. He decided to wait until he was really hungry. Then he would walk down to the fried chicken place five minutes away and get some food that was finger‐licking good.

        "text": "It was a perfect day in Los Angeles. So perfect that even Shakespeare, had he lived another 370 years, might have said he himself had not the words to describe it. Everyone's experienced such a perfect day at least once. The sun was shining, and soft white clouds were parked in the deep blue sky. The temperature was perfect for shorts and flops. Not cool, not warm—just perfectly in‐between. A lazy breeze occasionally stirred the leaves on the trees.\nSuch a day isn't typical. Most days in LA are quite hot. Most evenings are quite cool, even nippy. Also, inland weather is not always the same as beach weather. Burning up in Pasadena, you hop into your car and drive toward Santa Monica, thinking of diving into the refreshing cool ocean. Once you near the 405, however, you remove your sunglasses. What happened, you think. Where'd the sun go, you wonder, as you eye the gray sky, roll up the windows, and turn the heat on in your car. This doesn't happen most of the time, but it happens enough that you learn to always pack a warm jacket and long pants for a trip to the beach.\nJune is a peculiar month. It's preceded by about two months of hot weather and followed by about six months of hot weather. But June itself is usually cool, with a month‐long gray sky that looks \"rainy,\" but it never rains. Although many locals find June weather to be refreshingly cool, the local TV weather people complain daily. Every June day, they ask, \"When is the 'June gloom' going to end?\" They like to say \"June gloom.\" It rhymes, sort of, and it makes them feel clever.\nEventually, of course, the gray June sky reverts to a blue sky, with its yellow sun and high temperature. For the next six months, the local TV weather people complain about how hot it is. They ask, \"When will this weather cool down?\" They get excited if the temperature drops five degrees. They get excited if they learn about a faraway Pacific storm. They tell viewers that, even though it's battering the coast of Japan, it might soon bring LA relief from the sun and the dry weather. Of course, it never does. They fill up their allotted time by pointing to every little city on the LA map and telling you its temperature, even though the temperature for one city is rarely one degree different from that of another city. It must be a boring job to be a weather person in LA."

Eventually, you're going to poison the whole Earth with the pollution caused by your unrestrained use of coal, nuclear plants, natural gas, and oil to produce electricity. Our Earth will become unlivable. Do you think it's your piggish right to destroy Earth and everyone on it?\n\"The power outage that America just experienced was only six hours, a mere wake‐up call. I know what your electricity usage in kilowatt hours is daily nationwide. If your usage doesn't go down 10 percent by seven days from now, your next outage will be 24 hours. You've got the brains, America. I'm giving you the motivation—a kick in your big, fat, electrically heated and cooled butt. Every year, I'm going to kick you again. Next year's going to be a 72‐hour kick.\n\"You have ten years to figure out how to derive 100 percent of your electricity from water, sun, and wind—with no pollution. If you fail, I won't just shut down your power grid—I'll destroy it. You'll go back to living like the First Americans. And the rest of the world's piggish nations will suffer the same fate at the same time. So, all of you, find a solution to end your pollution. Save our Earth, save our selves! I know you can do it. And don't try to find me, or you'll regret it.\" One minute later, the message disappeared."

The testing room in the government building was freezing. As she hunched up shivering, she looked around and saw others feeling equally cold. Why couldn't these people let us know beforehand to bring jackets, she wondered.\nAfter getting the news that she had passed the test, she signed up with a realty company. They told her how much money she would owe them each month, and wished her good luck. Other than that, they weren't much help or encouragement. They told her how to have open houses on weekends. She had to carry big signs in her car and place them in the neighborhood around the open house. The signs were not always easy to push into the ground, nor did they always stay upright. To make matters worse, one Saturday evening she discovered that all of her signs had been stolen! Her realty company told her not to worry—they would just add the cost of replacing the signs to her monthly bill.\nAfter she had asked him many times, her husband finally accompanied her to an open house.

Because dogs hear sound frequencies that humans cannot hear, the melodies will be unheard by humans.\n\"There's a huge market for this service,\" Cobb declared. \"There's about 30 million dogs in this country, probably 2 million right here in the city. And what do these dogs love to do more than anything? Bark, that's what! And what do people hate more than anything? Barking dogs, that's what!\"\nCobb says that he went to India to study how snake charmers control the deadly cobra with music. He figured that if they could use music to prevent a deadly cobra from striking out at humans, he could use the same music to prevent a dog from barking. So he learned how to play the pungi, the snake charmer's flute. And he learned many of the same tunes that the snake charmers played.\nHe returned to New York, where he practiced the tunes on his dog. At first, his dog simply barked along with the music. After hours of modifying tunes, Cobb discovered one that actually caused his dog to stop barking.\nHe was jubilant. He had discovered a melody that would shut dogs up. He would be rich beyond his wildest dreams! Unfortunately, the melody worked on his dog, but not on his neighbor's dog. Nor on several other dogs in the neighborhood.\nCobb figures that computers will help him find the right melodies at the right frequencies to shut up any dog on Earth.\n\"My dream, of course,\" he said, \"is to discover one melody that will shut up a whole block of barking dogs. That might rank right up there with the discovery of penicillin!\"",

        "text": "When Holly was little, her dad gave her a box of crayons. Holly's first drawing was of her sleeping cat. \"Kitty\" was black and white. After using the red, yellow, green, and orange crayons, but not the black or white ones, Holly proudly showed her drawing to her mom.\nShe said, \"That's nice, Holly. What is it?\"\nHolly said, \"It's Kitty!\"\nHer mom said, \"It is? Show it to daddy, honey.\"\nHolly showed her drawing to her dad. He said, \"That's nice, honey. What is it?\"\nShe repeated, \"It's Kitty!\"\nHolly had drawn the insides of Kitty—brain, intestines, heart, and other parts. She had drawn the insides because she had a type of x‐ray vision. Unknown to her parents until that day, Holly saw only the insides of living things. When she looked at her parents' faces, for example, she saw bone, cartilage, tissue, muscle, and blood vessels. The only time she saw her parents' real faces was when she saw their reflections or their pictures. Holly had always asked her parents, \"Why do you look different in pictures?\" Now they understood her question.\nHolly became an accomplished anatomical artist before graduating high school. She went to college and eventually earned a medical degree. While in med school, she drew pictures of anomalies in the heads or bodies—she could see through clothing—of some of her instructors and classmates. All of them needed treatment; some needed life‐saving surgery.\nAfter graduating med school, she became \"Dr. Lifesaver.\" Using her drawing skills, special vision, and medical knowledge, she examined nearly 12,000 people a year for the next 30 years. She referred those who had tumors, diseases, and other abnormalities to specialists she knew.\nAfter 30 years, she learned that she herself had brain cancer. The operation that removed her cancer also mysteriously removed her \"x‐ray\" vision. But Holly was happy to have gained normal vision. She retired, eager to spend the rest of her life with her husband, kids, and grandchildren. None of her kids or grandchildren had inherited her \"x‐ray\" vision, but her oldest grandson had microscopic vision. If he wanted, he could see the microbes on doorknobs."

About 18 months after her first test, an agency sent her a canvass letter. The letter stated her list number. Also, it stated the job title, salary, borough, PT or FT, and shift. The bottom half of the letter contained nine boxes followed by Yes or No and a short, descriptive sentence. She checked the first box. Its sentence said: Yes, I am interested in this position; I can report to work by (date). She mailed the letter back, with her resume. She received letters from other agencies. She responded to each one the same way. Eventually, a supervisor called. He told her his name, agency, and the job title, and asked if she wanted to interview for it."

Then you can pour yourself cold water using the blue handle, or hot water using the red handle,\" Cynthia said.\nGeorge tried to tell her that she had too few clients coming to her office to need such a dispenser. He told her to buy a case of bottled water. She could keep the bottles cold in the office refrigerator. Plus, she had a stove and a coffeemaker in her office, so she could use either of them to produce hot water for her clients or herself.\n\"A contract with a water company is going to cost you at least $30 a month,\" he argued. \"And maybe you won't even be consuming that much water a month. Why don't you wait a few months and see how many clients you get and then decide if a water dispenser is absolutely necessary? If it is, buy it then. There's no rush to buy it now.\"\nIn addition, he argued, the trunk of her car was too small for the dispenser to fit into. Nor would it fit into her back seat. So, \"end of argument,\" he concluded.

The dispenser was in a box that was almost the size of Cynthia, but she carted it out to the parking lot and managed, somehow, to get it into her trunk.\nThat night, when George called, he asked, \"You didn't go back to Wal‐Mart and buy that thing, did you?\"\n\"Of course not!\" she told him.",

The cell phone call didn't trigger the explosion. Instead, some smoke started spewing out of the car.\nAn ambulance happened to drive by. The driver, seeing the smoke, called the police. The police arrived quickly, and a bomb expert immediately entered the car and started disarming the vehicle. A few minutes later, the police were notified about another car, also full of explosive material, parked behind the nightclub. That vehicle was also disarmed. Twice in one night, deadly explosions had failed to occur. The bad guys had lost—this time.\nA new prime minister had just taken over in England. He said that God was watching over London. Scotland Yard believed that terrorists were behind the bombing attempts. When one patron at the nightclub found out how close he had been to death, he said, \"I'm so happy to be alive!

You plugged the Clapper into an outlet. Then you plugged your lamp into the Clapper. By clapping twice, you turned the lamp on or off. It was a convenient gadget that also became popular with handicapped people. TV commercials showed grandma lying in bed reading. She put her book down, clapped twice, and went to sleep with a big smile on her face. She didn't have to reach for the lamp switch or get out of bed and turn off the wall switch. The only problem with the original Clapper was that your barking dog, or your neighbor's dog, could also turn your lamp on or off.\nThe current Clapper works with two lamps or other devices, such as radios and TVs. TV commercials show grandma reading in bed while the TV is on. She puts the book down, claps twice to turn off the TV, and claps three times to turn off the lamp. Then she goes to sleep with a big smile on her face.\nClapper Plus is a big hit, too. It can be adjusted to respond to the loudness of your clapping. It has a light to indicate if you are clapping loudly enough. It has an \"Away\" setting for security; when you're not home, Clapper Plus will automatically turn on a light or the TV if it detects a noise. The light or TV should help scare away intruders. Clapper Plus also comes with a remote control, so that if grandma is extra tired, all she has to do is click the remote. The two versions sell for about $20 and $30.\nA $40 version might be in stores next year.

        "text": "A man and a woman died in an apparent murder‐suicide last night in Altadena. The man was 74‐year‐old Dominic Vittorio. The woman was his 70‐year‐old wife, Victoria. The couple had been married for 50 years. In fact, their 50th anniversary occurred just a month ago, according to their next‐door neighbor, Mrs. Allen. The couple was childless and had no close friends. Mr. Vittorio was a retired carpenter who had emphysema and was blind in one eye because of a cataract. His wife was a diabetic who had already had one foot amputated because of complications from the disease. Her eyesight was almost completely gone.\n\"They were such a nice couple,\" said Mrs. Allen. \"I've lived next to them for the last 20 years or so. I'm widowed, and Dom always used to help me with things like changing light bulbs and fixing appliances. They had no kids, but they were always friendly to the neighborhood kids. Every Halloween they handed out tons of candy and fresh fruit. But about eight years ago, Vicky came down with diabetes, and things just haven't been the same for her or Dom. They used to be so friendly and full of life, and then they just seemed to get quieter and quieter.\n\"She used to come over to my place once or twice a week, and we would talk about all kinds of things and have the nicest time. But that happened less and less as she got sicker. So I would go over to her house about once a week and we would talk. But the conversations steadily got shorter, and she seemed to lose interest in listening and in talking. She didn't say it, but you could tell she was in a lot of pain.\"\nMrs. Allen said she hadn't even talked to either of the Vittorios in almost a year. They never came out. Even food was delivered to them by a local agency. She said she heard two gunshots last night. \"It scared me half to death!\" She immediately called the police. \"Such a sad ending for such nice people,\" she said. \"Together in sickness, but alone in the world.\"",

Classes begin on Monday, May 1, and will continue throughout the summer. Fifteen swim classes are being offered. Each class lasts ten hours. A new class starts each week of the summer. Each class costs $20. The pool is big enough for six students per class.\nClasses will increase in difficulty each week. The first week is for children up to six years old. The last week is for advanced swimmers who want to improve their race and endurance skills.\nStudents can sign up for as many classes as they like, but they must pass the skills level test. For example, students who sign up for Level 4 (Stroke Readiness) must show their certificate for completing Level 3 or must demonstrate the front crawl and backstroke. Children cannot sign up for a level they are not ready for. Children who have never attended Community Pool classes must show up April 29 or 30 for a swim skills evaluation. Instructors will rate the students and assign them to a particular skill level.\nSwim classes are fun for all. Children learn new skills and make new friends. Parents get to meet other parents in the community. Swimming, like bicycling, is a healthy and valuable skill that, once learned, is never forgotten.\n\"It's a joy to teach young children,\" said Ginger, the lead instructor for swimming programs. \"More than half of them are terrified when we put them into the water the first time.

        "text": "Jimmy lives on the second floor of a six‐unit apartment building. His front door has two locks—a security deadbolt, and a regular door handle lock. The front door also has a peephole—a tiny piece of glass through which Jimmy can look out his door at about eye‐level to \"preview\" who is knocking on his door or ringing his doorbell.\nThe peephole is a security device, but Jimmy never uses it. When someone knocks, he just opens the door. First of all, he lives in a safe neighborhood, so security is not really a problem. Second, people rarely knock on Jimmy's door, so he is always eager to greet a visitor.\nBefore visitors can knock on the front door, they have to push the button on the black screen door to open it. The screen door has an inside lock on it, but the lock has not worked since the screen door was installed more than two years ago. This has bothered Jimmy from day one. Today, Jimmy finally decided to do something about the lock on the screen door. It was a nice, warm, sunny day. Jimmy was in his shorts—no flip‐flops, no shirt.\nThe lock was part of the screen door pushbutton handle. The outside and inside handles were held together with just two screws. Jimmy got a flathead screwdriver and loosened both screws. He kept adjusting the screws and pushing on the outside button. Eventually he adjusted the screws enough to where the lever stayed in the locked position when he pushed on the outside button. Finally, he had made the right adjustment.\nBut now he needed to put a spacer on the inside handle to maintain that adjustment. He found a piece of plastic that was just the right thickness. He inserted the plastic between the handle and the doorframe itself, and then he tightened the two screws. Bingo! It worked perfectly. He could push on the outside button with all his might, and the lever would remain locked. Jimmy grinned. The screen door finally worked properly!\nJimmy had fixed a two‐year‐old problem in less than an hour. He was ecstatic. He returned the screwdriver to the toolbox, thinking, I'm a genius!",

She was examining her 50‐foot putt on the par 5 tenth hole when she heard her mother scream. Ginger turned around just in time to see her mom driving straight toward her. The force of the collision knocked her over, and the cart then ran over her foot.\nHer mom, 81 years old, said that a squirrel had jumped up into the cart looking for snacks. She tried to shoo the squirrel away. Instead, it rose up on its hind feet and made a hissing sound. Startled and frightened, the old lady hit the gas pedal.\nThe paramedics arrived about 15 minutes later and treated Ginger for a broken left ankle. They gave a mild sedative to her mother, who kept muttering, \"Vicious, simply vicious!\" Then they took Ginger to the hospital. Mr. Rogers promised his wife he would visit her after he finished his round.\nJohn Dean, an attorney for the golf course, said the golf course was not responsible for the actions of its animals. He added, \"If the ladies want to sue, they'll have to sue the squirrel. We're still assessing the damage to the cart and the green. It looks fairly light; I doubt that the driver will owe us more than $1,000.\"",

The day had been completely pain free. The doctor had had to cut into Brad's face three times. The cancer hadn't invaded bone. Throughout the day, Brad had noticed other patients in the waiting room with big, white bandages on their faces. Two patients had bandages on their mouths. Dr. Eduard sutured Brad's face with dissolving stitches and then with regular stitches. He explained the follow‐up care that Brad needed to do and gave him prescriptions for an ointment and for pain. He told Brad to return in a week to get the black, outer stitches removed. Brad thanked God as he walked to the bus stop. I don't deserve it, he thought, but thank You for looking out for me today."

She spent her days each weekend with her two horses at a stable that was only a mile from her house. Jasper spent his weekends at a small lake where he had a mobile home and a boat. He often brought home fresh fish. Evelyn and Jasper's romantic life wasn't what it used to be, but their love was as strong as ever.\nEvelyn had three sisters. They all lived in Georgia, and they had been badgering her for years to move to Georgia so they could all be together. Jasper resisted the idea because he was familiar with Georgia's suffocating humidity. He finally relented when the sisters said they had found a condo that was only 100 feet from a dock on a huge lake. The condo price included a small boat and a space for it on the dock.\nJasper flew to Georgia to look the place over. When he returned, he told Evelyn that they should put their house and mobile home up for sale. He said he would still prefer to remain in New Mexico, but the Georgia place looked all right, although small. But most important, he said, was that she would be happier living near her sisters. Evelyn was touched; how could she ever pay him back for being so considerate?",

        "text": "Joan's job is to use American Sign Language to enable instructors to communicate with English‐speaking deaf students. She went to school for three years to get her certificate. According to Joan, learning ASL was not that difficult, but learning to be an excellent interpreter could take a lifetime.\nThree years after enrolling at Pierce College, Joan graduated as a Certified ASL Interpreter. Plenty of job opportunities were waiting for her. She likes the college environment, so she applied for a job at Newton Community College, a school with 28,000 students. There are 22 hearing‐impaired students at NCC. Joan has worked with most of them.\nThey are very friendly with her. Often they invite her to have a cup of coffee after class. They talk about school and about what they hope to do after graduation. Sometimes the women talk about personal things, especially about how hard it is to find \"Mr. Right.\" Joan agrees with them, saying she herself has given up on finding him. They also talk about their favorite movies, books, and music. Even deaf people can \"hear\" music. Many are good dancers.\nJoan is one of the four interpreters on campus. Two are full‐time; Joan works part‐time. She accompanies a deaf student to class. The student sits in the front row. Joan usually sits near the teacher, facing the student. She signs as the teacher talks. If the class is less than 90 minutes long, there is only one interpreter per student. If the class is longer, there are two interpreters per student. They alternate; one interpreter will sign for 20 minutes, and then the other will.\nJoan will go back to school soon. She wants to become a Certified French Sign Language Interpreter. She already speaks French fluently; her mom taught it to her. Her mom also taught Joan that American men are hopeless. She frequently told Joan that only a French man knows how to make a woman feel like a woman. Joan idolizes her mom, and takes her advice to heart. It will take Joan about three more years to get certified.\nWhat then? Then she will leave California, move to Paris, find a romantic French boyfriend, and live happily ever after. That's her plan."

The will disclosed an astounding amount of money his father had accumulated during his lifetime. Chad, the sole survivor, was now rich beyond his wildest dreams. It was as if he had won the state lottery.\nSo, there was only one thing to do. Ever since he was a little boy living in a 19‐foot trailer, Chad had dreamed of living in a big house with a big yard and a big dog. Well, now the dream would come true.\nChad called up several Realtors and invited each to his tiny apartment so that he could tell them about his dream. The first three Realtors pretended to believe that Chad could afford the type of house he described to them. They all said they would get back to him. They didn't. Two weeks after talking to the third Realtor, Chad met and talked to a pretty, female Realtor. She said she would find him one of the best and biggest houses in the state.\nA month later, she called to tell him that she was going to pick him up and drive him to his dream house. When they got there, it was even better than Chad had imagined. It was a three‐story, 42,000‐square‐foot behemoth.\nThere was a two‐lane, mile‐long \"driveway.\" There was a 10‐car garage. The mansion had porches, balconies, fireplaces, gardens, and all kinds of trees. It had a heated swimming pool, a lighted tennis court, a gymnasium, a bowling alley, a theater, a music room, and a ballroom.\nIt had four master suites, each containing a huge bedroom, two bathrooms, a living room, kitchen, and dining room. Each suite had its own temperature controls. There were two staircases and three elevators in the house, each elevator big enough to hold a grand piano. The main kitchen had five refrigerator‐freezers lined up side by side. The formal dining room seated 60. Next to it were a menu‐planning room and a silverware room. In the basement was a huge wine cellar.\nThe living room easily had space for eight or nine sofas and as many coffee tables. The library, next to the reading room, had enough shelving for almost 10,000 books. The property also had two guest houses. It had everything except a big dog.\nChad took it. A month later he bought four Great Dane puppies, and a year later he married his Realtor."

How would you like being called an 'old brown guy'? Second, you're saying that old white guys never vote for people of color. That's not only false—it's racist.\n\"Third, this country was founded by old white guys, in case you forgot. They wrote the First Amendment, which allows you to say what you just said. Then there are the old white guys who fought in World War II. Without them, you'd be speaking Japanese right now. I guess you forgot about that too. And what about the old white guys who created our national transportation and communication systems, health care system, and power grid?\n\"Finally, old white guys created light bulbs, motion pictures, air conditioning, elevators, planes, vaccines, TVs, computers, Cadillacs, Walmarts, and McDonalds. These are just some of the things that have helped make America the greatest country in the world, the country that everyone wants to come to. Then when they get here, some of them—like you—complain about the very people who made this country worth coming to.\n\"You bad‐mouth them, yet you enjoy using everything they created. You've made a small fortune in America, yet you constantly talk about how great your home country is. So why are you here? Go back home. Make room for people who appreciate old white guys and everything they've done.\"\nThe host said, \"I'm not going anywhere, and I don't owe old white guys anything.

You must be selected to serve; juror names are selected from state identification cards, driver's licenses, and voting rolls. If selected, you will receive in your mail an envelope marked Jury Summons. Call the 800 phone number to find out the first day of your service. If that date is inconvenient for you, you can change it to a later date. You cannot serve more than once every 12 months.\nIf you are mentally disabled or are a full‐time caregiver, you may be excused from service. If you have no reasonable means of transportation to court, you might be excused. If you are a full‐time student or teacher, you won't be excused. If you are a breast‐feeding mom, you can postpone your service. If you are dead, your family must provide proof of death.\nTo serve on a jury, you must be able to read and understand basic English. Your age doesn't matter, as long as you are at least 18 years old. Once you're 70, you can say that you're too sick to serve; you don't need a doctor's excuse. If you're younger than 70, you need a doctor's note confirming that you are ill. Blind people, deaf people, and people in wheelchairs can be required to serve on a jury.\nYou will not get paid very much for your service—$15 a day. Also, the state will reimburse you 34 cents for each mile that you drive in your car (one way only). Some employers will pay your salary while you serve; some won't. If you own a business, you might be away from it for one to four weeks, occasionally even longer. You could lose a lot of money if you do most of the work for your business.

The murals record scenes from the Bible. Arthur Anderson, an artist, and Eric Bush, a painter, had been to the church many times before. But they were not aware of any trap doors in the building.\nThe only reason they discovered the door was that Arthur dropped a coin onto the floor while pulling a small knife out of his pants pocket. He heard the coin hit the floor and roll. He started searching. A minute later, he found his dime. \"Gotcha!\" he said proudly. But then he saw what looked like an unusual gap in the floorboard. With his knife, he began digging around the gap.\nThe floorboard suddenly loosened. Arthur felt that he was onto something. He removed the floorboard and saw a rope handle attached to what looked like a trap door. Eric helped Arthur remove four more floorboards. Then Arthur slid open the trap door.\nBeneath it was a hole in the ground about 15 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. They shined a flashlight into the hole and saw the murals. They were not wrapped, covered, or otherwise protected. Yet they were in wonderful condition, according to Eric.\n\"God truly does work in mysterious ways,\" said Arthur. The murals use only the colors black, red, and yellow. The smallest are about 12 by 12 inches, and the biggest are about 24 by 24 inches. Digital photographs were taken of all the murals before they were loaded onto a truck.\nAll 23 murals, created about 1791, are now at the Museum of Native American Art. They will be inspected, cleaned, archived, and examined by experts. They will not be put on public display until early next year. Museum officials expect a huge turnout when that day occurs. \"This is truly rare,\" said one official. \"I wonder how many more treasures are out there waiting for someone to drop a dime on them.\"",

        "text": "\"Good evening, everybody!\" said the teacher, Donna. \"Where is everybody?\"\nThat was sort of a daily joke by Donna. Usually the class started with only two or three students present, and then filled up as the minutes went by. It was summertime. Summer school was only eight weeks long. Class attendance was always smaller than during fall and spring semesters.\n\"I don't know, teacher. Maybe they late or no come,\" said one student. \"Maybe watching TV football tonight.\"\n\"Is there a soccer game tonight? It seems like there's a soccer game every night. Oh, well. Let's get started, okay? We're on page 36 in the workbook. Tonight we're studying participles as adjectives. Students are always confused when they learn about the present and past participles, so we will practice this a lot. Tonight, we're just going to practice the present participle.\n\"The present participle tells us what emotion or feeling the subject is causing. For example, 'Grammar is boring' means that the subject \"grammar\" causes an emotion of boredom. If we say, 'The movie is interesting,' we are saying that the movie causes a feeling of interest. If we say, 'The roller coaster is exciting,' we are saying that the roller coaster causes a feeling of excitement. Any questions so far? Am I confusing you? Is everyone confused?\"\nThe classroom was quiet. Donna looked at blank faces. They were confused. She knew this would take a while. But eventually, the faster students would grasp it, and then they would help the slower students. By the end of the evening, most of the class would feel comfortable using the present participle.\nDonna erased the board and put some new examples on it. She loved guiding her students through difficult topics like this one. She always felt a little bit thrilled when the look of understanding came to their faces.",

        "grade": 5.6,
        "text": "A drunk driver speeding along in his SUV on the 60 freeway last night killed three of four people in a sedan. The sedan had slowed to a crawl because of construction work on the 60. Four lanes were merged into two. The Department of Transportation crew was making repairs to a three‐mile stretch of highway. Hundreds of bright orange traffic cones guided the merger. Four heavy‐duty trucks were parked in the emergency lanes. Their brightly glowing signs said, \"Slow. Be prepared to stop. Construction ahead.\" Vehicle traffic had slowed to about 3 mph.\nMissing all of these warnings, the drunk driver, going at least 50 mph, plowed into the sedan. The sedan driver, a computer programmer, was a recent immigrant to America. In the passenger seat was his wife, and in the back seat were his 6‐year‐old daughter and his 8‐year‐old son. It was 9 p.m. The family had been at a restaurant to celebrate the little girl's birthday. They never knew what hit them.\nThe impact of the collision caused the sedan to explode in flames. Somehow, the sedan driver managed to crawl out of the car seconds after the explosion. Third‐degree burns covered much of his body. His chances for survival are slim. His life, as he knew it, is over. His loved ones were burned beyond recognition. The car was a skeleton of metal.\nThe 28‐year‐old drunk was not only unhurt, but was able to escape from his smoldering SUV and run away, leaving two whiskey bottles behind. The police tracked him down this morning. He claimed that his brakes had failed. A police spokesperson revealed that he has four prior convictions for driving under the influence."

        "text": "A 20‐year‐old man, driving under the influence and at excessive speed early yesterday evening along New York Drive, died after clipping another car. Buddy Allen was dead at the scene of the accident. Apparently, he was not strapped into his seat belt at the time he collided with a car in front of him.\nAllen was doing about 60 mph on the 35 mph street when his SUV overtook and hit a car driven by Steve Frohman. Frohman, a scratch golfer, had just finished an unpleasant round of golf—he had lost $20 on the 18th hole. He said he was doing the speed limit when he happened to look in his rearview mirror and saw an SUV coming up on him fast.\nCertain that he was about to get rear‐ended, Frohman managed to get halfway into the adjoining lane. The speeding SUV hit Frohman's new sedan, then hit a curb, and became airborne. Allen flew out of his SUV, landing on grass near the base of a light pole. Frohman, braking to a stop, saw Allen land on the grass. But the unthinkable happened. Upside down but also flying through the air, the SUV struck the light pole and dropped straight down, landing squarely on Allen.\nFrohman ran over to the SUV. He could see both of Allen's feet. Frohman tried to rock the SUV back and forth so that it would roll off Allen. Not succeeding, he dialed 911 on his cell phone. Police and paramedics arrived within a few minutes. Frohman was still trying to roll the SUV off the victim when they arrived. The police told him to move back. Four of them rolled the SUV off Allen. The paramedics did not even check for a pulse; they knew a dead person when they saw one.\nOne of the police officers congratulated Frohman on his attempt to save Allen.\n\"I wasn't trying to save him,\" said Frohman. \"I was going to give him a knuckle sandwich for damaging my car!\" 5.6, 338"

A few classmates had helped her move. After all the boxes, clothes, and furniture were in the new apartment, Florence treated her three friends to a fantastic dinner at Sur la Table, a local French restaurant. Dinner included a couple of delicious and expensive bottles of wine. Everyone hugged when the meal was finished, and Florence drove home by herself.\nShe did not answer or return phone calls the next two days. \"I talked to Sara and Jeri. Annabelle had not returned their calls, so I decided to go over to her new place,\" said classmate Vicki. \"When I got there, her car was in the parking lot. The roof was down on her Miata convertible. I thought that was strange, since it had sprinkled the day before.\n\"Her apartment door was closed. After I knocked and knocked, I tried the door. It was not even locked. I walked inside, calling her name. There was no answer. I was getting very nervous, especially when I went into the bedroom and the bathroom. But no one was there. All her boxes were unopened, her clothes were still not hung up, and nothing was in the refrigerator.\"\nThe police are investigating. Florence's credit card has not been used in the last two days, nor have any calls been made from her cell phone during that period. She is simply missing, with no signs of violence and no clues as to where she has gone.\n\"It doesn't look good,\" said one detective.",

Mrs. Brown lives by herself in a trailer park near Clovis. She said that Clyde, her 7‐year‐old cat, didn't come home for dinner more than a month ago. The next morning he didn't appear for breakfast either. After Clyde missed an extra‐special lunch, she called the police.\nWhen the policeman asked her to describe Clyde, she told him that Clyde had beautiful green eyes, had all his teeth but was missing half of his left ear, and was seven years old and completely white. She then told the officer that Clyde was about a foot high.\nA bell went off. \"Is Clyde your child or your pet?\" the officer suspiciously asked.\n\"Well, he's my cat, of course,\" Mrs. Brown replied.\n\"Lady, you're supposed to report missing persons, not missing cats,\" said the irritated policeman.\n\"Well, who can I report this to?\" she asked.\n\"You can't. You have to ask around your neighborhood or put up flyers,\" replied the officer.\nMrs. Brown figured that a billboard would work a lot better than an 8\"x11\" piece of paper on a telephone pole. There was an empty billboard at the end of her street just off the interstate highway. The billboard had a phone number on it. She called that number, and they told her they could blow up a picture of Clyde (from Mrs. Brown's family album) and put it on the billboard for all to see.\n\"But how can people see it when they whiz by on the interstate?\" she asked.\n\"Oh, don't worry, ma'am, they only whiz by between 2 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. The rest of the day, the interstate is so full of commuters that no one moves.\" They told her it would cost only $3,000 a month. So she took most of the money out of her savings account and rented the billboard for a month.\nThe month has passed, but Clyde has not appeared. Because she has almost no money in savings, Mrs. Brown called the local newspaper to see if anyone could help her rent the billboard for just one more month. She is waiting but, so far, no one has stepped forward.",

It was coming out of a storm drain. Alvin used his cell phone to call the fire department.\n\"The storm drain is on fire!\" he said. The fire department asked for his whereabouts and he said he was near 6th and Main. They said they'd be right there to investigate the situation. Alvin didn't have to be anywhere, so he waited for the firemen to arrive. He was curious himself as to what could possibly be burning beneath the street. As far as he knew, there wasn't anything beneath the street except concrete. And everyone knows that concrete doesn't burn.\nA fire truck arrived a few minutes later. \"Are you the man who called?\" asked the driver. Alvin said yes. By now Alvin could hear crackling sounds, like wood burning. The firemen didn't seem to consider it an emergency.\n\"What do you think it could be?\" Alvin asked the driver.\n\"Oh, we know what it is. We have to take care of a problem like this every few months. It's the homeless people in their 'houses.'\"\nHomeless people have been living under the streets for years. Using their knowledge of the storm drain system, they set up their own \"bunkers\" beneath the streets. These living areas frequently contain tables, mattresses, chairs, and sofas. The residents often \"borrow\" electricity by connecting to a live wire above‐ground to power their own lamps and even TVs underground. Either this borrowed electricity or a discarded cigarette causes an occasional fire.\nAlvin watched as a couple of firemen lifted a manhole cover and descended beneath the street with a fire hose. A few minutes later, the black smoke turned white. Shortly afterward, the firemen reappeared with a homeless person who seemed to have just been woken up."

The previous semester, she had been a student in Nelson's grammar class, but she had to drop the class because her son Kendall was having a problem in school. The problem was that he wasn't studying. Catherine had decided that Kendall needed more motivation. She provided that motivation by watching him like a hawk. She also restricted his use of his Game Boy. He was allowed to play the computer game only on weekends.\nNelson was getting to be an old man. He had been teaching various subjects for over 30 years. He could have retired several years ago, but he loved teaching. He said his students gave him something to look forward to every day. He said he planned to teach until he dropped dead in the classroom.\nNelson accepted Catherine's invitation. He decided to take a little gift to Catherine to show his gratitude for the invitation. But he couldn't think of what would be appropriate. Opening his kitchen cabinet, he found the perfect gift—an unopened box of tea. In a kitchen drawer, he found some fresh‐looking wrapping paper. He wrapped up the box of tea expertly.\nFriday evening, he drove over to Catherine's and rang the doorbell. Once inside, he presented his gift. Catherine made a funny face. She said she loved the wrapping paper. Then she unwrapped the tea and made another funny face. She said, \"Nelson, I gave this tea to you when I dropped out last semester, and I wrapped it in this paper!\"\nNelson gulped. His face turned a little red. He told himself he had better remember to actually buy gifts in the future. He apologized to Catherine. She smiled and said, \"It's okay. It's the thought that counts, yes? And, I really like this tea!\" 5.5, 302"

Like it's my job in life to set you up with women. Are you okay to drive? Every time I saw you, you had a beer in your hand. You can stay here tonight if you want.\"\nJack said, \"Thanks. I didn't have that many beers. I paced myself. You've got to know your limit when you're on a bike.\"\nHe said good night, put on his helmet, got on his motorcycle, and drove off. Traveling at about 60 mph on an unlit, two‐lane road, he missed a curve and drove into an open concrete culvert. He lay next to his motorcycle for 20 minutes before a truck driver noticed the wreckage.\nA half hour later, Jack was lying on a gurney in the local hospital. Moaning in pain, he was unaware of his condition or whereabouts. The emergency room doctors gave him no medication—they needed to examine him thoroughly before taking him to surgery.\nHis jaw was broken, as were all three bones in his right leg. Part of his femur was protruding through his thigh, and there was a deep hole in his shin just below his knee. Dr. Kildare wanted to amputate Jack's leg just below the knee. He said the hole in the shin was so deep that infection would be inevitable. He figured amputation then would be better than amputation later.\nDr. Welby disagreed. He said Jack was young enough to heal rapidly, with little possibility of significant infection. Since Dr. Welby was in charge, Jack was allowed to keep his leg. Dr. Kildare would just have to wait for another banged‐up motorcycle rider.\nThe day following surgery, Jack achieved consciousness briefly in his hospital room. He didn't notice that his leg was suspended and completely immobilized. He didn't notice that there was an IV tube and needle taped into the back of each hand. He didn't notice that his jaw was wired shut. All he noticed was that a beautiful young nurse was looking at him. He tried to introduce himself, but he had no idea what his name was. He went right back to sleep."

He'd emailed her about a safety hazard. He had suggested installing a window in the lobby door. Sometimes people leaving the lobby pushed the door open hard. A window would allow people leaving to see people entering. A window would help prevent people leaving from knocking down people entering. Two days later, the door had a new window. \"See what quick service we gave you?\" she said. Sid wondered why he should be thanking her. Someone who got knocked down could sue the building owner. The owner would have to settle lawsuits. Sid's suggestion would help prevent lawsuits, saving the owner money. In fact, by reporting safety hazards, Sid was actually doing management's job. Lorraine should be grateful to him. But he smiled and said, \"Thank you.\" 5.4"

The cheapest thing to do was to go to a salvage yard.\nCalifornia has about 50 salvage yards. Most of them are in southern California. The yards range in size from 10 acres to 70 acres, holding anywhere from 300 to 3,000 abandoned, wrecked, or cheaply sold cars. The yards are usually located outside of downtown but near a freeway ramp.\nA salvage yard might pay you up to $200 to take your rundown car off your hands. Before they place it in the yard, however, they will remove all its liquids—oil, gas, coolant, brake fluid, transmission fluid, power steering fluid, and windshield washer solvent. Vehicles usually sit in the yard for only a month before they are crushed, stacked, and then transported to a recycler.\nVehicle parts are inexpensive, but you have to remove them yourself. The carburetor that Daniel needed was only $20. Nothing in the yard, however, comes with a guarantee. If it doesn't work or fit, you can replace it with a similar item, but you won't get your money back.\nDaniel borrowed his brother's car. After paying the $3 entry fee to the man in the little wooden shack, Daniel walked into the yard. He walked about five minutes before he found the foreign car section. It looked like there were at least 200 cars. It was sunny and hot. There was no shade anywhere in the yard. Carrying his toolbox, Daniel went searching for a matching carburetor.\nAlmost three hours later, Daniel was back at the shack. He bought himself a cold soda from a machine. A few minutes later, he paid the $20 plus tax and walked out of the yard. Driving home, he wondered if all the work was worth the savings. If the carburetor didn't work, he'd have to do this all over again.\nWhen he got home, his brother Monty was standing next to Daniel's car. Monty had a big smile on his face. \"Hey, guess what?

When Karl's wife died a couple of years ago, he told the Social Security Administration to stop sending monthly checks to his wife. But the agency continued to send the checks. Karl called again; a clerk said not to worry. He told Karl to mail a follow‐up letter that included his wife's date of death. But the checks continued to come. Karl needed the money, so he cashed his wife's checks.\nWhen SSA finally realized its mistake, it sent Karl a letter saying that he owed SSA $5,900 plus interest. Karl receives only $12,000 a year, which is slightly above poverty level. The only savings that he ever had, $5,000, was spent on his wife's funeral. He fought on Iwo Jima, site of one of the most furious battles of World War II. The battle left him deaf in one ear and almost blind in one eye.\nHis small house used to be in a good neighborhood. He takes the bus once a week to visit his wife's grave. The rest of his time is spent at home, where he carves wooden military figures that he donates to a local charity. The charity sells the carvings and uses the money to help feed the homeless.\nSSA gave Karl six months to pay the debt in full. Otherwise, the SSA letter said, the agency would seize his home. Karl wrote back, asking if it would be okay to pay $30 a month. That was all he could afford.\n\"That's insufficient,\" said William Shatner, an SSA agent. \"We know that he is a war veteran, but that doesn't entitle him to free money. He knew that his wife was dead, yet he cashed her monthly checks. That is fraud, pure and simple.\"",

Sometimes you're miles from the nearest gas station or McDonald's. Everyone knows that when you gotta go, you gotta go,\" said Phil Bole.\nPhil has invented a chemical toilet for vehicles. One size fits all (vehicles and people). It is made from recycled materials. It never smells bad, he claims. Between uses, it can be stored in the trunk. When the toilet is full, an adult or child can compress it into the size of a bowling ball. The waste matter in the toilet is continuously being absorbed by chemicals and bacteria. Eventually, all the waste matter turns into a pile of dry crumbs. The toilet can be dropped into any trash can at any time.\nPhil tested his invention while on a two‐week vacation with his wife and four young kids. He said that the kids loved it. His wife didn't.\n\"Nothing on Earth could make me use that disgusting thing!\" she told him. He pleaded with her, saying that he had invented the toilet primarily for women and kids. He needed a woman's blessing so the toilet would sell. \"No woman would ever use this thing!\" she responded.\n\"My wife's sort of a prude,\" Phil said one day to Bret, his mechanic. After much thought, Phil finally figured out how to make his wife love his invention: he made a pink toilet covered with yellow flowers. \"What more could a woman want?\" he asked while showing it to Bret.

The client had accidentally spilled a diet soda onto the defendant's new sneakers, so he broke the client's jaw. The judge sentenced the defendant to two years in jail for assault and battery. But after handcuffing the defendant, the sheriff's deputy also handcuffed Mantle. \"What the heck do you think you're doing?\" Mantle shouted.\n\"Sorry. Judge's orders,\" replied the deputy, as he escorted Mantle and the defendant out of the courtroom. \"She said to throw you in jail overnight for contempt of court.\" Because the judge had already left the courtroom, Mantle had no one to protest to.\nMantle and the convicted man were put in the back of the same van and driven five miles to the city jail.

At every corner, he put the four heavy, plastic bags on the sidewalk. He stood next to them. He stretched his fingers. He stretched his arms. He stretched his back.

Adam's oldest brother was, in fact, a priest. Adam, as a youth, had been an altar boy and had prayed to God to become a priest. Instead, God made him a fireman. Constance had seriously thought about becoming a nun, but that was before she met Adam.\nHer heart fluttered at her first sight of Adam. He was taking pictures with kids at a charity event. What a big, strong man, she thought. And so good‐looking! Constance took her nephew over to get his picture taken. She couldn't believe it when she saw that Adam was wearing a St. Christopher medal around his neck. He's Catholic, too!, she marveled. Not being a shy woman, Constance started up a conversation with Adam.\nOne thing, as they say, led to another. Both sets of parents were so happy that their child had fallen in love with a Catholic! There was a huge wedding at the cathedral. Adam's brother married the two lovebirds. Everyone said it was the best wedding ever.\nWhen Adam and Constance got around to opening their gifts a few days later, Constance opened an envelope from her uncle Chandler. In it was $100 cash. But, the cash was inside a Jewish card for Happy Hanukkah! The note in the card was, \"I couldn't find a wedding card that I liked. I know this is Jewish, but it really is a beautiful card, don't you think? Love, and Best Wishes.\" Constance did not send her uncle a thank you note, nor did she ever talk to him again. She was unable to think about her wedding again without thinking about that card.",

Three monkeys, which usually were friendly beggars, sat on his balcony railing and watched. They were hoping that he would offer them some food. When he finished watering the plants, he sat down in a chair to enjoy the sunset.\nThe monkeys waited a minute. When they realized that he was not going to feed them anything, they leaped on him. They scratched his face and pulled at his hair and his clothes. Bleeding and screaming, he panicked. Instead of going back into his apartment through the sliding glass door, he leapt off his balcony. He lived on the second floor, so it was only ten feet to the pavement below. However, he struck the pavement head first, immediately breaking his neck.\nThe monkeys jumped to the pavement. They dug through his shirt and pants pockets looking for food. One monkey took off with his keys. As humans destroy the forests in India, monkeys like these are getting hungrier and more aggressive.\n\"Our monkeys are getting out of control,\" said a neighbor. He said he had already barricaded his balcony with barbed wire. \"It's ugly, I must admit. A balcony shouldn't look like the outside of a prison. My neighbors want me to take it down.

On the weekend, Renee was at the stables from morning until dark. She fed, groomed, and rode her horses. She was an excellent rider. She would ride the horses bareback on Saturday, and then she would saddle them up on Sunday.\nRenee loved parades. She used to say, \"A parade isn't a parade without a horse.\" Renee loved parades almost as much as she loved her horses. She belonged to an email list of volunteers for parades. She regularly checked out the state website list of parades to see if there were any new parades that she didn't know about. All the state parades were organized in her computer. In the Parades file, she listed the date, drive time and distance, parade time, contact people, and other details she felt were important.\nShe knew the parade director of every town within a four‐hour drive. She never stayed overnight. She always left the parade in time to get her horses back to the stables before \"bedtime.\" She had to feed them before they turned in. Her horses seemed to like parades, too. They knew a few tricks that always impressed the children.\nRenee was very generous with her time and her horses. But owning horses wasn't cheap. She had to rent the stables, and there were always veterinarian and feed bills. Renee knew how to cope with expenses, though. Her vet always gave her a 10‐percent discount for paying cash. She always bought the no‐name, generic feed for the horses. Her vet had told her it was just as healthful and tasty as the brand name stuff. She always bought economy gasoline. And on parade days, Renee always packed her own lunch and ate with her horses."

They went to one trade show after another, flying throughout the U.S. and often to China and other countries. Their last vacation was at least ten years ago. Recently, Oscar's doctor said that Oscar's high blood pressure was going to be the death of him. After questioning Oscar about his eating and exercise habits, he concluded that Oscar was stressing himself out at work. He told Oscar that he needed to stop and smell the roses more often.\n\"In short,\" he said, \"I'm writing you a prescription for two weeks of R&R—rest and relaxation, immediately. In fact, I want you to take off four weeks a year, and these must be nonworking vacations. No cell phone, no laptop. Do you understand me? In case you don't, I'm telling Meg, too. You might not listen to me, but you will listen to her.\"\nMeg canceled all their activities for the two weeks at the end of July. Fortunately, they did not have any flights scheduled. She booked them a nice hotel near Palm Springs. \"We'll catch up on our magazines, newspapers, and TV reruns,\" she told Oscar. \"We won't even talk about work for two weeks, okay?

Most parents take their small kids right up to these characters. If the child doesn't start bawling because he or she is afraid of the cartoon character, the parents will take snapshots or videos of their kid with Snow White, Grumpy, Goofy, or others. Often the camera will be rolling even when the child looks afraid or is crying.\nLast week, Eva Gunderson took her 7‐year‐old son Billy Bob to Disneyland. Pluto was the first character they met once they got inside. Eva asked Billy Bob if he wanted a picture with Pluto. Billy Bob said no. He said Pluto's tail was too skinny and his nose was too big. Eva told him to go ahead, please, just so she could show daddy. Billy Bob reluctantly agreed.\nHe went over to Pluto and sat on his lap. Eva said, \"Say cheese!\" and both Billy Bob and Pluto said the magic word. Then, as Billy Bob got off Pluto's lap, he grabbed Pluto's round, black, plastic nose and ripped it off Pluto's costume. Pluto yelled, \"Ouch!\" (even though it didn't hurt). Billy Bob started running, and Pluto started chasing him. Just as Pluto got close enough to grab him, Billy Bob kicked Pluto between his legs. Pluto fell to the ground, groaning. This time he really was in pain.\nEva got it all on video cam. \"That was great, honey!\" she told her son as they walked off to find more characters. \"Wait till daddy sees this.

        "grade": 5.0,
        "text": "The mailman delivers good news and bad news. Topping the \"bad news\" list for many people who live in Los Angeles is a jury summons. This document tells you that you must respond by mail or phone for possible service on a jury. Many people feel that jury duty is a boring chore and would prefer not doing it.\nIn fact, court clerks say that the most common question they hear is: Why do I have to serve? The official response is: Jury duty is a responsibility that all qualified citizens must share.\nIf you are a citizen, if you can read and understand English, if you're over 18 years old, and if you're not a felon, you are eligible for jury duty. If you ignore the summons, you might be fined up to $1,500.\nA jury trial might last one day or one month. If you work for the government, this is no problem, because the government will pay you your regular salary while you are on jury duty. However, if you are self‐employed, you lose your regular income for that time period. Instead of your regular income, you get $15 a day for sitting on a jury. This is another reason people try to avoid jury duty.\nJack got the bad news yesterday. Even though he was retired and sat around all day watching reruns of old movies, he told his wife Polly he wasn't going to be a juror. He hated jury duty, and he was not going to let the courts interfere with his retirement.\n\"So how do you think you are going to get out of it?\" Polly asked, both amused and irritated. \"Are you going to claim that you're dead? Or are you going to tell them you've moved out of the country?\"\n\"No, both of those involve too much paperwork. I've got a better idea. It's a medical excuse. It says here that if you have a physical disability, you can be dismissed.\"\n\"What's your disability? Your 'bad back' doesn't allow you to sit in a chair watching reruns all day?\"\n\"No. Something better than that. I've got gas. It'll offend the other jurors and everyone else in the courtroom. They'll have to open all the windows or issue gas masks.\"\n\"But there's one problem. You don't have gas.\"\n\"But I know how to create it. I'll eat a lot of peanuts and fruit the morning that I go to court. As soon as they get a whiff of my 'problem,' they'll tell me to go home and stay home.\"\n\"That's a brilliant idea!\" Polly said, as she rolled her eyes. At least it would get him out of the house for one day, she thought.",

It had been her experience that many ESL students continued to speak their native language in ESL class, and Tara had not come to ESL class to practice her Arabic. In her opinion, ESL students should try to speak English only.\n\"I agree,\" said Rose.\n\"You're 100 percent right,\" agreed Jennifer. \"Rose and I must stop speaking Arabic to each other. Right, Rose?\" Rose nodded, and then said something in Arabic.

His sister had kept or sold all the furniture in their parents' house, which was in the same town she lived in. She was upset that their parents had left the house solely to Brett. She had told Brett that he should do the right thing, and give her money for \"her\" half of the house.\nHe had hired two movers at $40 an hour. They worked hard and fast. Brett was impressed with how they had maneuvered their large truck into a tight loading area. Movers seemed to know lots of tricks—some good, some not so good.\nBrett was a bachelor, but in the last 30 years he had accumulated a lot of stuff in the various apartments he had lived in. The movers were there for the big stuff—the bed, chest of drawers with mirror, refrigerator, computer desk, coffee table, dining room table, TVs, stereo, sofa, and, of course, the books. Earlier, Brett had packed more than a thousand books into cardboard boxes and sturdy paper bags. More books than he would ever have time to read, unless scientists discovered a cure for the aging process. What a day that would be!\nThe movers were finished in only four hours. Brett gave them each a $10 tip. He wondered if that would be an insult or a compliment. They smiled and said thanks. (He would never know.) He told them he would meet them at the house in a few hours.\nThe apartment now looked a lot bigger, but there was still a lot of work to be done. All the big things were gone, but there were lots of smaller things. The kitchen cabinets were still full of dishes, plastic ware, and canned and packaged food. All the towels, bedding, and clothes were still in the bedroom and bathroom. In the living room and hall closet were his golf clubs, fishing rods, and toolboxes.\nHe was going to have to pack all this by himself and then make many car trips to his parents' house. He had thought about asking his best friend for some help, but then decided against that. Jerome had helped Brett make his last two moves. A friend can ask just so many favors from a friend before a friend loses that friend, especially when it comes to helping a friend move or taking a friend to the airport. Brett decided, if worse came to worst, he'd just pack all the remaining things and then hire the movers again.\nHis phone rang. It was his sister. During a thunderstorm the previous evening, lightning had struck her house, starting a fire that burnt the house down before the fire department showed up. Luckily, she, her husband, their daughter, and their cat escaped unharmed. But they were going to need a place to live while their house was rebuilt."

At least, he thought he had one; no one had ever called him back to confirm his reservation. Probably a confirmation call wasn't even necessary, he thought.\nHe didn't feel comfortable giving blood nowadays, no matter how much they talked about the unlikelihood of getting infections. As far as Gabriel was concerned, if anything involved humans, it also involved the possibility of human error. But he was willing to take the risk because he liked to think that this was his way of \"giving back\" to his community.\nWhen he started his car, he knew the gas station would be his first stop after the gym. He wouldn't have time to gas up before his appointment, because long gas lines were a daily problem as people tried to beat the rising gas prices.\nGabriel parked his car and walked into the gym. No other donors were there. Six staff people, identified by their \"Give Life\" T‐shirts, were inside the gym. He walked over to Andrew, the staff supervisor.\n\"I have an appointment at two o'clock to donate my blood,\" he said.\n\"Well, we're ready if you are,\" said Andrew, smiling.\n\"I'm ready, willing, and able.\"\n\"Great! Just fill out this form.\"\nGabriel filled out the form in just a few minutes, and then gave it back to Andrew. Andrew gave the form to Alexis, who asked Gabriel to sit down at her table. She asked him if he liked the new forms. He asked what was new about them.\n\"I don't have to ask you about 30 questions that I used to have to ask you, so they save both of us time.\" She asked Gabriel to hold out his hand.\n\"Which finger do you prefer?\" she asked, as she unwrapped the needle that she was going to prick his finger with to get a blood sample.\n\"Oh, it doesn't matter. They're all the same to me. Where is everybody? The last time I was here, the gym was full,\" Gabriel said.\n\"I don't know. It's not even 2:15 yet. I'm sure it will start to get busy shortly. We're hoping that everyone shows up,\" Alexis said.\n\"Maybe you ought to give away free T-shirts to encourage a good turnout,\" Gabriel suggested.\n\"Or free gas to guarantee one,\" Alexis said, smiling."

True love was something that Ann and Bob knew everything about. There was hardly anything they disagreed about. Even when they disagreed, they settled the disagreement in such a way that both were totally happy. This was truly a match made in heaven.\nThey had already made plans for the wedding. It was going to be a big wedding. Every relative from both families had already been notified about the date. All their friends knew about the big day. The invitations were already printed. The priest, the church, the reception hall, and the limousine service were ready to go.\nNothing was being left to chance. This was going to be the happiest day of their lives. Ann had gone to several wedding web sites for ideas and help. Of course, she had also consulted her mother, grandmothers, aunts, and married friends about how to plan the perfect wedding.\nEach one of them tried to tell her that there was no such thing as a perfect wedding. There was always at least one thing, or more usually one person, that made the wedding a seeming disaster at the time. But of course, like the disaster that happens on one's vacation, that incident or person would be what makes the wedding more memorable.\n\"Oh, you should have been at my wedding,\" said Aunt Mabel to Ann. \"My brother James was in charge of the rings that Kyle and I were going to exchange. On the wedding day, James presented the ring to Kyle, who put it on my finger. An hour later at the reception, I took the ring off to admire it and read the inscription. I gasped. The jeweler had spelled my name 'Mable' as in table. My name, as you know, dear, is spelled Mabel as in label. So I went to the ladies' room and cried for almost half an hour. No one could console me.”\n\"So, the moral of the story, my dear,\" chimed in Aunt Prudence, \"is to make sure that Uncle James isn't in charge of getting your rings engraved. Not that you would have a problem. How could anyone misspell your name—it only has three letters, and two of them are the same.\"\n\"Aunt Prudence, you know that isn't true,\" said Ann. \"Half the people I know spell my name with an 'e.' But, Uncle James is not in charge of our rings, so I'm not worried.\" 4.9, 437"

She started walking down to the corner. There were four buildings at the intersection of Lima Street and Sierra Madre Boulevard. One was her bank. Just north of it was a fast food restaurant. A dry cleaner was catty‐corner to the restaurant, and a small, one‐story office building was catty‐corner to the bank.\nLong before she arrived at the corner, she could smell the fried chicken. The restaurant was open seven days a week, and the odor of fried chicken was in the neighborhood daily. She didn't mind the odor of deep‐fried birds. She still ate poultry and fish, even though she had recently sworn off red meat.\nHer diet change had occurred suddenly about a month ago. She was walking to the post office on Baldwin Avenue. She smelled something that she guessed was a dead animal. The odor seemed to be coming from the dumpster ahead of her on the left. Ordinarily she would hurry by the dumpster. But because there had been several incidents in the TV news recently about people leaving dead babies in dumpsters, she decided to investigate this one.\nLifting one of the two plastic lids on the big dumpster, she held her breath as best she could and peeked inside with only one eye open. She didn't see a dead baby. She was thankful for that. Instead, she saw a dead cat. Maggots, she guessed, were busy eating at its flesh and guts. The sight almost made her gag. She quickly dropped the lid, walked a few steps upwind, and took a deep breath of fresh air."

Gerard had bought it six years ago, but it was a 100‐month battery. It was fully guaranteed for the first 12 months, and then pro‐rated after that.\nGerard called Sears. The service rep told him he would probably get \"$10 to $40\" credit toward a new battery. Gerard wondered how there could be such a $30 range, but he didn't bother to ask. If the problem was electrical, he asked the service rep, what would Sears fix? The rep said Sears only replaced alternators and starters; if the electrical problem involved something else, Gerard would have to take it to the dealer.\nGerard went out to pull the battery out of his car so he could recharge it overnight. Then he could hook the battery up the next day and use a meter to see if the electrical system was working properly. He opened the hood. He looked. He looked some more. Where was the battery?! Had someone stolen it?\nHe opened the manual. The manual said nothing about the location of the battery. He called up his friend Bryan. Bryan told him that he was looking in the wrong place; the battery was under the rear seat. Gerard scoffed. \"Nobody puts a battery under the rear seat—except Volkswagen,\" he told Bryan.\n\"Well, it's got to be somewhere if it's not under the hood,\" Bryan replied. Gerard went back out to the Buick and lifted up the rear seat. He found a few coins, some real old chewing gum, a paperback novel, and a watch battery, but no car battery.\nEnough was enough. Gerard called AAA's emergency road service. Before the tow truck driver towed the Buick to Sears, Gerard asked him if he knew where the battery was. \"Oh, sure,\" he said. \"It's under the hood, but you'd never know it because it's completely hidden by the big, white plastic windshield washer reservoir.\"",

Where was the battery?! Had someone <+===+> it? <+===+>He opened the manual. The manual said <+===+> about the location of the battery. He called <+===+> his friend Bryan. Bryan told him that he <+===+> looking in the wrong place; the battery was <+===+> the rear seat. Gerard scoffed. “Nobody puts a <+===+> under the rear seat—except Volkswagen,” he told Bryan. <+===+>“ <+===+>, it’s got to be somewhere if it’s not <+===+> the hood,” Bryan replied. Gerard went back out <+===+> the Buick and lifted up the rear seat. <+===+> found a few coins, some real old chewing <+===+>, a paperback novel, and a watch battery—but no <+===+> battery. <+===+>Enough was enough. Gerard called AAA’s emergency <+===+> service. Before the tow truck driver towed the <+===+> to Sears, Gerard asked him if he knew <+===+> the battery was. “Oh, sure,” he said. “It’s <+===+> the hood, but you’d never know it because <+===+>’s completely hidden by the big, white plastic windshield <+===+> reservoir.” ",

Sandra finished putting her toothbrush and toothpaste into her travel bag; those were the last two items on her \"to pack\" list.\nShe had called ahead, of course, to get a room for Janice and herself. The hotel told her that no more rooms were available at the price that was advertised in the newspaper. This was no surprise to Sandra. So, she put down a $100 nonrefundable deposit on a room for two nights. The cost for both nights was going to be $200 plus taxes, surcharges, and other fees.\nShe looked at her watch. Janice was late, of course. Sandra had forgotten to remind Janice of today's departure time. To put it kindly, Janice was not exactly the most organized person in the world. Sandra called Janice up. She left a short message: \"Where are you? It's time to go to Vegas!\"\nA few minutes later, Janice called back. She had a big problem—a schedule conflict. She had already promised to attend her daughter's eighth‐grade graduation ceremony \"this very weekend!\"\n\"Oh, Sandra, I'm so sorry,\" Janice said. \"I know how much you had wanted to do this. I thought Alice's graduation ceremony and party were next week. I get so confused sometimes. I'll make this up to you, I promise. Maybe you can call up Lily. She might be available, even though it's really short notice. If not, don't worry, I'll pay you for everything and we can make plans again.\"\nSandra sighed and dialed her friend Lily. She wondered how Janice had made it through life so unorganized.",

The secretary he had talked to on the phone sounded friendly and encouraging.\nMaxwell was a typist. His fingers danced on the keyboard. However, his people skills were not nearly as good as his typing skills. Sometimes his mouth got in the way of his employment. At his last steady job, his boss had told him to start making coffee every morning. Maxwell laughed. \"I'm not making coffee,\" he said. \"It's not part of my job description.\"\n\"Read the employee manual again,\" his boss said. \"Your job description is anything I say it is.\"\n\"That's a woman's job,\" said Maxwell. \"Do it yourself.\"\nHis boss was still yelling as Maxwell walked out of the building. He felt great about telling off the boss. A few days later, the reality of not having a job hit home. He had to pay the rent and utility bills, and he had to eat. What was he going to do?\nHe thought about apologizing and asking for his job back. But how would that look? Then again, who cares how it looks when you're almost broke? After thinking about it for another week, he finally called his boss and apologized. His boss accepted his apology, but said that he had already hired a replacement.\nMaxwell contacted a temporary job agency, which provided him enough occasional work to pay his bills. But none of the companies that he was sent to were hiring. So Maxwell was excited about finally getting an interview for a steady job.\nMaxwell's drive to the interview was disappointing. The traffic was congested and the neighborhood looked rough. It took him 45 minutes to get there. The building was covered with graffiti.\nThe interview started 30 minutes late. Not bothering to apologize, the manager lit a cigarette and took a sip from his coffee cup. He leaned back in his chair and put his feet up on his desk. He asked Maxwell a lot of questions. Maxwell thought that each question was stupider than the preceding question. The final question was, \"Where would you like to be 10 years from now?\"\nWhat does that have to do with typing? Maxwell wondered. Stupid questions from a rude man in a lousy neighborhood! Where would he like to be 10 years from now?\n\"Anywhere but this dump!\" Maxwell said angrily, as he stood up and walked out.",

Alfred said that this was the fourth time he had called in the last three weeks. He said he wanted to talk to the supervisor directly. The rep said that he would leave a message for the supervisor to call Alfred. Alfred rolled his eyes; he had heard this before. He was beginning to wonder if a \"route supervisor\" even existed.

        "text": "Chris loved to shop at thrift stores. Almost a month ago, he bought a popular word game that uses little chips of wood with different letters on them. As he was purchasing it, the clerk said, \"Oh, look, the game box hasn't even been opened yet! That might be worth some money.\"\nChris examined the box, and, sure enough, it was completely enveloped in factory‐sealed plastic. When he looked at the box cover, he saw that beneath the name of the game and the description was a copyright date of 1973.\n\"You should put that up for auction on the Internet, and see what happens,\" the clerk said.\n\"Yes, you're right,\" Chris agreed. \"I think I'll give that a try. The rarity of something is part of what increases its value, and I can't imagine there being very many unopened boxes of this game still around 30 years later. Maybe it's worth millions!\"\n\"Well, if it is, don't forget who told you about the wrapper,\" the clerk smiled.\n\"No problem. You're getting a percentage of anything over $10,\" Chris said. The game itself was priced at only $1.99, and the clerk gave Chris the usual 10‐percent senior discount.\n\"You've got yourself a deal, partner,\" she replied, laughing.\nAt home, Chris went online to several auction sites looking for his game. He couldn't find it anywhere on the auction sites. Then he typed in the name of the word game and hit Search. The response was 5,543 sites containing that name or parts of it. Chris examined the first 10 sites and found a site that listed people looking for various versions of the game.\nOver the years, the game had been produced using different chip sizes, colors, materials, and even fonts. In addition, different game boards were produced over the years, themselves consisting of different colors and fonts. The game board had never changed in size or material. Most of the game seekers seemed content with used games. Only a few even mentioned \"fresh,\" unopened games. Those who wanted unopened games all promised top dollar. Chris emailed all of them, telling them what he had.\nTwo weeks later, Chris went back to the thrift shop. He said to the clerk, \"How are you doing, partner?\"\nShe looked at him for a second, then recognized him and said, \"Oh, hi, partner!\"\n\"I've got something for you,\" he beamed. \"I'm sorry it didn't turn out to be millions. Maybe if I waited another 20 years, but by then the plastic wrapper might have rotted off. Here's your share.\" He handed her three $100 bills.\n\"Wow!\" she exclaimed. \"Thank you! You're such a nice partner. How much did you get for it?\"\n\"One thousand. I hope that you're okay with 30 percent.\"\n\"Okay?! I'm thrilled! I never expected to see a dime. We'll have to do more business together.\"\n\"You got it, partner!\" Chris smiled."

The move would put some memories behind him. He was looking forward to a fresh start.\nRandy and Nora had gotten married six years ago. It was the first marriage for both of them. Eight months after the marriage, Nora found out she was pregnant. That was good. When she started getting stomachaches, they figured it was the new baby. But then she miscarried.\nThe stomachaches, however, continued. In fact, they got worse. It wasn't a simple stomachache. It was liver cancer. Then it was stomach cancer, lymph gland cancer, breast cancer, and brain cancer. It never stopped spreading. There was little hope, but Nora battled the daily pain with smiles and few complaints.\nAfter five years of doctors, hospitals, chemotherapy, and surgery, Nora lost the battle. More than one million dollars was spent on medical bills, more than ten thousand prayers were said by family and friends—all to no avail. The only time that Randy asked the doctor for his honest opinion, the doctor said, \"She might have six months.\" Nora died seven days later. Just before she died, she silently squeezed Randy's hand.\nThe mover took six hours longer to load the moving van than he had estimated originally. Randy wondered how much extra this was going to cost him. After the mover and his crew had departed for California, Randy noticed a 3‐foot‐long scar in his new hardwood floor. It looked like the crew had dragged his heavy metal bed frame. Randy hoped the new homeowner wouldn't complain about it too much. He wondered how many damaged goods were in the moving van.\nThe phone rang. It was the California‐bound car transporter. He told Randy that his truck was in Alexandria at Fifth and Main, and he would wait for Randy there. Randy walked out to his car. In five minutes, he was at Fifth and Main. He gave the transporter the ignition key and watched him drive his car up the ramp onto the truck. There were five other cars already on the truck. The transporter said, \"I'll call you in nine days,\" and drove off. Randy hailed a cab.\nEleven days later in Santa Monica, Randy got the call. The transporter said he would be there in three hours. Five hours later, the transporter arrived. Randy watched as the transporter backed his car down the ramp. The car was filthy. The transporter explained that bad weather had slowed him down—tornadoes, rain, and dust storms. No locusts?, Randy wondered.\nRandy drove his car to the carwash. While sitting in a chair waiting for the car to be finished, he saw a pretty young woman waiting with her boyfriend. They were talking and laughing. Then they stood up. They kissed, and she went across the street. Watching her, Randy thought about Nora squeezing his hand."

When they got back, they opened all the gifts and sent out thank you notes. But there was one problem. A married couple that used to be good friends had apparently given nothing. This surprised Julia, because Walt and Mary said they were thrilled to be invited. And, they actually seemed to have had a great time at the wedding. Frankly, Ray didn't even care if they hadn't given a gift. He just needed to know whether to send a thank you note. Ray called Aaron. Aaron said maybe Walt had left an envelope on the gift table like Aaron had. \"Yes, but we got your envelope with the cash inside,\" Ray said.\n\"Maybe my envelope looked too thin, and some thief thought Walt's envelope looked nice and fat.\"",

The cars were heading west through the intersection, and Webster pulled out as if they weren't even there. Fortunately, the two cars slowed down and let Webster complete his turn. How could he not have seen the cars, Noah wondered.\n\"Didn't you see those two cars?\" he asked Webster.\n\"Yes,\" Webster answered. But because he was in the middle of the intersection waiting to make the left turn, he was worried that he was a sitting duck for other traffic. So he was just trying to get out of the intersection. Noah felt like he had just aged 10 years. This was the second near‐death collision in the last five minutes with his student driver. In his 40 years of driving, Noah couldn't remember a day like this.\nHe told Webster to pull over. They exchanged seats. Noah got back onto the 210 freeway, and headed west to Allen Avenue. As he drove, he explained to Webster all the mistakes Webster had made earlier while driving on the 210. \"I thought you passed driving school,\" Noah said. Webster had, but he said that was two years ago, when he was 16. Since then, his mom hadn't let him drive at all, because her car insurance didn't cover Webster.\n\"Oh, so you're really rusty,\" Noah said, understandingly. Not only was he rusty, Webster agreed, but 15 minutes ago was the first time he had ever driven on the freeway—he was scared to death, he told Noah. \"Oh, gee,\" Noah said, sympathetically. \"Yeah, the first time you're on the freeway, it's really scary. But believe me, the surface streets are more dangerous. Every intersection is a crash waiting to happen.\"",

The baby had been in and out of the hospital for the last year because of infections and other problems. She was very weak and sick. The doctors were not confident that she would live another year.\nTaking care of Jessica was expensive. The family was deep in debt. Roland, an independent subcontractor, had medical insurance, but he had very high deductibles.\nThings were bad. Roland saw no light at the end of this tunnel. Then he saw an ad in the newspaper: \"Security guards, contract workers wanted. $100,000 a year. First $80,000 tax free. $20,000 bonus for extending contract an extra year.\" He called the number. The line was busy, but he kept calling and finally got through. He was worried that the jobs were all taken, but they told him plenty of jobs were still available. They said they would give him two weeks of training in Texas. Then they would fly him to Iraq for his assignment.\nRoland told Sheila he had to take this job. He knew it was dangerous; he might get injured or killed, but the money was too good. Plus, the family would have full medical benefits, which would enable the baby to get the care she needed. Roland said if he survived the first year, he would probably sign up for the bonus and a second year.\nSheila was worried. She asked, \"What if you get killed? What are we going to do without you?\"\n\"You can't think like that, honey,\" he said. \"You've got to think positive. Think about how well off we'll be in two or three years after I bring back all that money. This is the best thing I could do for this family.\"\nSheila hugged him and sobbed. \"I don't want you to go.\"\nRoland flew to Houston five days later.",

Usually, he got very good deals; occasionally, he got ripped off.\nA few days ago, Adrian bought six packages of ink for his printer. Then he found a deal on better ink at the local computer store. So Adrian went back to the $1 Store to exchange the ink for some other items.\nHe put the ink into a plastic bag and tied it up. When he entered the store, he immediately showed the bag to a clerk and told her that he was returning some items. She looked at him but said nothing. There were about ten people in her line. She was obviously very busy. Not knowing exactly what to do, Adrian put the bag into a push‐cart and started shopping.\nHe was midway through shopping when a female employee suddenly stopped him. \"Sir,\" she said sternly, \"you are not allowed to carry a plastic bag of items around in this store! What's in this bag?! Show me what's in the bag!\"\nAdrian was taken aback. There was no need for her to yell. He opened the bag and showed her the six packages of ink. \"I'm returning these to exchange for some other items,\" Adrian said.\n\"You should have left the bag with the clerk when you entered this store. Let me see your receipt!\" the employee demanded.\nAdrian was embarrassed. He felt like a shoplifter. He looked around to see if anyone was paying attention. He showed her the receipt.\n\"Perhaps in the future, you'll learn how to follow store policy. Leave this bag here with the clerk. You can have your receipt and bag back when you check out.\"\nBy the time Adrian had finished shopping and exchanged the items, he was angry. How dare she treat him like a criminal! He went looking for her. He wanted an apology. He found her in the produce section and asked what her name was. She mumbled something. He asked her again, and this time he heard \"Ursula.\"\n\"Ursula what?\" he asked.\nShe yelled at him, \"Ursula!\" and stormed away.\nWhen Adrian got home, he called the store's corporate headquarters. This rude employee is about to lose her job, he said to himself. He described his unpleasant experience to a customer service representative. She was sympathetic. \"Our employees are taught to be polite. We will not tolerate such behavior. Give me your phone number and I will call you back.\"\nTwo days later, Adrian received a phone call from the representative. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, \"but there's no one at that store named Ursula. Can you describe her? I'll find out who she is. I assure you, we do not tolerate rude behavior, nor do we tolerate lying to customers.\"\nBy this time, Adrian had calmed down. He didn't really want the employee to lose her job. He told the representative to forget about it.",

It starred the young and handsome Tad Biff and the young and beautiful Jenny Lopez.\nBarbara invited her sister Laura to the movie. Both of them were big fans of Tad, even though both of them were well over 40. Barbara had picked the 5 o'clock show on a Tuesday evening, figuring that the crowds would be thin. For Barbara, thin crowds meant fewer annoying people.\nThe lobby was almost empty. There was only one man at the food counter buying popcorn for his young son. As they walked by, Barbara said, \"What a cute little boy! What's your name?\"\n\"I'm Benton and I'm almost 5‐1/2 years old,\" the boy said proudly.\nBarb and Laura walked inside. They picked their favorite seats, right in the middle of the whole theater. There was no one within 20 feet of them.\nThe theater darkened and the movie started. A few minutes later, some people sat directly behind Barb and Laura. Barbara couldn't believe it. The theater was 90 percent empty, but these people had to sit right behind her. She hoped that they weren't loud, obnoxious jerks.\nA minute later, Barbara felt a bump on the back of her seat. Then, another bump. Then, another. Someone was kicking the back of her seat. Barbara tried to ignore the kicking, but it wouldn't stop. Steam started coming out of Barbara's ears and nostrils. She turned around and yelled, \"Stop kicking my seat right now, you jerk!\"\nIt was Benton. He spilled his popcorn, wet his pants, and started bawling. His father yelled at Barbara for yelling at Benton, and Barbara yelled back at the father for not controlling his son. The father took his son out to the lobby to minister to him, and Barbara resumed watching her movie.\n\"You didn't miss a thing,\" said Laura."

At first he shrugged off the symptoms, figuring he had picked up a bug that would go away in a week or so. But it didn't. It lingered. After three weeks, he dragged himself to Dr. Barkley.\nThe doctor did a few tests. Then he asked Benjamin if he had gone camping and drunk unsterilized stream water. Benjamin said the last time he had gone camping was in the army many years ago.\nThe doctor asked if Benjamin had eaten at any fast food restaurants in the past month, or eaten from one of the many lunch trucks in the Los Angeles area. Benjamin said that he ate fast food or lunch truck food every day at noon.\n\"That's probably the source of your illness. You have hepatitis A, and you most likely got it from a food worker who didn't wash his hands thoroughly after using the bathroom. It happens a lot.\"\n\"Holy cow! I'm not going to die, am I?\"\nThe doctor told him not to worry. A viral infection that attacks the liver, hepatitis A kills only about 100 people annually in the U.S. He told Benjamin to see him every two weeks, and to be prepared to take up to three months off from work so that he could rest, rest, rest. There is no cure for hepatitis A. Fortunately, most people survive; only a few don't.\n\"And there's another good thing about hepatitis A,\" Dr. Barkley said. \"Once you get it, you're immune to it for the rest of your life.\" 4.7, 283"

It had started the second time she turned the key, but that made her nervous. Sooner or later, she might have to turn the key three times, then four times, then four hundred times. \"Sooner or later,\" of course, might occur at the worst possible time in the worst possible place. Besides using the car for school and personal errands, she needed it for work. Without the money from her two jobs, she couldn't pay her bills.\nShe had called her mechanic. He said to bring the car in when she had time. When was that, she wondered. She said she'd call him back. She had two jobs. Her day job was at Koss, a popular clothing store on Foothill Boulevard. As a new hire, she was at the bottom of the ladder. Her assignment, five days a week, was to rehang clothes on hangers.\nShe worked near the dressing rooms. Customers were allowed to take a maximum of five clothing items into the dressing rooms. They were given a tag with a number on it. The number matched the number of items they were taking into the dressing rooms. They returned the tag, with the items, to a worker when they exited the dressing rooms. The tag number and the number of items had to match, of course.\nLisa was not the worker who handed out and retrieved the tags. She was the worker who hung all the tried‐on clothes back onto the hangers. Large signs in the dressing rooms said \"Please Hang the Clothes Back Up on the Hangers,\" but most customers ignored the signs.\nWhen she didn't have any clothes to hang up, she kept busy folding clothes, picking clothes off the store floor where people had just dropped them under the racks and rehanging them on the racks, or putting clothes in their appropriate sections on the racks—small, medium, large. She also patrolled the store, picking up trash or out‐of‐place items that had been moved around by customers and looking for spilled liquids that needed immediate mopping up.\nEventually, she hoped to work her way up the ladder to be a cashier. Her boss, whom she had caught eyeing her a couple of times, had already offered her a cashier job, but there was a catch. She had to go out to dinner with him. She had demurred. He was, in a word, creepy. Further, he was fat, with a pock‐marked face and a thick moustache, which he stroked far too often. She didn't know which he loved more—himself or his moustache."

She worked there from 6 p.m. till midnight. Most of her customers tipped her well. Older men gave her the biggest tips. Many of them asked her out, but they were all too old for her.\nYounger guys asked her out, too, but she was particular. She refused them all, waiting for the right one to ask her. She had seen the \"right one\" once, but he was with a girlfriend, she guessed. She hoped that, sooner or later, their relationship would end. She didn't mind waiting. She was so busy, even if he did ask her, it would be hard to fit him into her busy schedule—but of course, she'd find a way to fit him in!\nWhen she wasn't working, she was taking weekend college classes. Slowly but surely, she was going to get a degree. She wanted to get married eventually, but she also wanted to be an independent woman, before and during marriage. But that dream wasn't going to work out if her car didn't work right. That dream wasn't going to work out if she got stuck in the wrong place at the wrong time and got robbed, mugged, or worse. She especially worried about being stuck at midnight at Lenny's, with its poorly lighted and sometimes empty parking lot.\nHer mechanic wasn't open on weekends. But since he was the only mechanic that she knew and trusted, she decided to ask her boss for a day off from Koss. Then she could still drive to Lenny's that night after her car was fixed. She would miss only one day of work. That wasn't too bad.\nHer boss would probably give her the day off—without pay, of course. She only had to worry about one thing. Her boss might give her the day off, but on one condition—that she have dinner with him. She knew what her response would be. She would say yes, but on one condition—that, before dinner, he shave his moustache off."

The rock music he was listening to was loud enough for the baby to hear too. Holly saw the baby waving its arms. Was it dancing? A teen girl with dyed, bright red hair startled Holly as she zoomed by silently, and illegally, on her bike. Holly figured it was just a matter of time before she injured or killed a child or an elderly person.\nA dad walked by with his little girl, saying, \"Don't do that. It looks stupid.\" Another little girl walked by, asking her mom repeatedly, \"What's that?\" Two older women walked by arm in arm. Holly wondered why men never walked arm in arm. A woman walked by pushing the flimsiest stroller Holly had ever seen. It had four tiny wheels. Holly hoped that there was a dog, not an infant, inside the stroller.\nMissing Holly's feet by inches, an old lady whizzed by on her big, red, four‐wheeled motorcart. Holly didn't even know the name of the vehicle. It wasn't an electric wheelchair, and it wasn't a car. But it looked like a small car. It looked like something that belonged on Emmons Avenue, not on the walkway. Holly hoped, but only a little, that the old lady would collide with the red-haired teen."

Between their house and their neighbor's house was a dirt pathway. The path led to a city‐owned dog park, where dog owners could let their dogs run free. But there was no parking lot for dog owners' cars. Dog owners had to park on the street, and then walk their dogs to the leash‐free park.\nIn 1980 no one seemed to know about the park. The only people who used it were the people who lived in the neighborhood. The neighbors used to joke that they had their own private dog park.\nThose were the good old days. Things have changed. The park has become like California in the Gold Rush days. Everyone knows about it. A dog may be man's best friend, but 1,000 dogs certainly are not.\nOver the years, the neighborhood association, consisting of about 70 houses nearest to the park, has begged the city council to reduce park hours. It is open from 7:00 to 7:00, seven days a week. But some dog owners actually arrive at 6:00, saying that they need to beat the rush. To save walking distance, others park in neighborhood driveways. Others bring boom boxes and play music loudly in the park. Others knock on neighborhood doors and ask to use the bathroom. Weekends are even worse than weekdays. Whole families spend the day with their dogs. People, dogs, noise, and trash are everywhere.\n\"We're stuck here,\" said Arnold. \"I've been trying to sell my place for five years. But when buyers see all this dog traffic, they take off running. What a joke. This place was heaven when we first moved here. Not anymore.\"\nThe city council has ignored the neighborhood association's pleas for help. A council member said, \"We have to meet the public demand. This no‐leash park is very popular. I'm sorry, but if the homeowners don't like it, they can always move. This is a free country, you know.\"",

Dog <+===+> had to park on the street, and then <+===+> their dogs to the leash-free park. <+===+>In 1980 <+===+> one seemed to know about the park. The <+===+> people who used it were the people who <+===+> in the neighborhood. The neighbors used to joke <+===+> they had their own private dog park. <+===+>Those <+===+> the good old days. Things have changed. The <+===+> has become like California in the Gold Rush <+===+>. Everyone knows about it. A dog may be <+===+>’s best friend, but 1,000 dogs certainly are not. <+===+> the years, the neighborhood association, consisting of about <+===+> houses nearest to the park, has begged the <+===+> council to reduce park hours. It is open <+===+> 7:00 to 7:00 seven days a week. But <+===+> dog owners actually arrive at 6:00, saying that <+===+> needed to beat the rush. To save walking <+===+>, others park in neighborhood driveways. Others bring boom <+===+> and play music loudly in the park. Others <+===+> on neighborhood doors and ask to use the <+===+>. Weekends are even worse than weekdays. Whole families <+===+> the day with their dogs. People, dogs, noise, <+===+> trash are everywhere. <+===+>“We’re stuck here,” said Arnold. “ <+===+>’ve been trying to sell my place for five <+===+>. But when buyers see all this dog traffic, <+===+> take off running. What a joke. This place <+===+> heaven when we first moved here. Now it’s <+===+>.” <+===+>The city council has ignored the neighborhood association’s <+===+> for help. A council member said, “We have <+===+> meet the public demand. This no-leash park is <+===+> popular. I’m sorry, but if the homeowners don’t <+===+> it, they can always move. This is a <+===+> country, you know.” ",

They were brother and sister, and she had gotten them for free when they were kittens. The cat in the dumpster had probably been run over, she thought. People drove too fast in her neighborhood, and cats were occasional victims. She never let Spot and Dash out of the apartment. They weren't going to die in the street. Their only acquaintance with the great outdoors was when they sat on the window ledge in her living room.\nA couple of days after viewing the unfortunate cat, she was at a restaurant with a couple of friends. The restaurant served a variety of delicious hamburgers. She had tried, and liked, all of them. She ordered a hamburger, medium rare, as was her liking. When the waiter brought everyone's orders, they all dug in.\nShe bit into her burger, and then spit it out into a napkin. She couldn't eat her burger, and she couldn't sit there and watch her friends eat their burgers. She made up an excuse, gave a friend enough money to cover her meal and tip, and left the restaurant.\nWhen she had bitten into her burger, she immediately pictured the dead cat. That was it for her. She refused to eat red meat anymore; she didn't want to risk seeing that cat over and over. Fish and poultry were all right, though. She could still enjoy both without thinking of the dead cat. She promised herself that she wouldn't lift the lids of any more foul‐smelling dumpsters, just in case they contained a dead fish or chicken. Much worse, of course, would be if she actually saw a dead baby. How might that affect her desire to have children? 4.6, 319"

        "text": "Once a week, Neil went grocery shopping. He always made a list, but he always forgot to put one or more items on the list. This used to anger him, but now he just accepted it. You're not as sharp as you used to be, he told himself.\nIt was Friday—shopping day. He went to the 99 Cents store. Sometimes they had a lot of fresh produce, sometimes they didn't. He got lucky. There were fresh, packaged broccoli, celery, eggplant, and squash. Also, packages of peaches, plums, and apples. He easily had enough produce to last all week, if it didn't rot first. The produce alone filled up four plastic bags. Four other bags contained other items that were on Neil's list.\nHe drove to Albertson's, which sold milk by the gallon and at cheaper prices than the 99 Cents  store. Interestingly, the price of milk had soared in the last month. He used to buy 2 gallons of nonfat milk for $3.59. Now he was paying $4.69. Yet, the news media was silent—the same news media that reports a 2‐cent increase in gasoline prices or even a 1‐cent decrease. That's all over the news. Milk, he thought, just isn't sexy enough.\nHe parked his car in the carport and opened the trunk. Somehow he managed, as usual, to put all 10 plastic bags into his hands and lug them upstairs. What a drag shopping is, he thought. And then he mentally slapped himself: if you think it's a drag now, wait till you can't drive. Wait till you can't even walk up the stairs unless you use a cane. How are you going to get your groceries then? The older you get, he told himself, the more you'd better appreciate the fact that you can still do all these boring chores and errands.",

The police caught a 19‐year‐old who they think fired the shots. He will be tried. If convicted, he will go to prison for 20 years, where he will get free food, housing, and medical care. And where he'll learn how to commit other crimes.\nBut because the prisons are so overcrowded, he will probably get out in 10 years. So, at the age of about 30, he will be out committing more crimes, while three children and eight grandchildren will never get to grow older with their grandma.

Five minutes later he finished his smoke, turned off the music, and started back inside.\nJust then, he heard two loud sounds, one right after the other. Both sounds were caused by falling human bodies. Two small Cessna airplanes had just crashed 1,000 feet overhead. One body made a loud cracking sound as it went through the roof of a new Corvette. The other body landed on the back end of Bert's Camaro. At about the same time, an engine from one of the planes crashed through the roof of the showroom. It killed the district manager of the dealership, who was on the phone ordering a pizza.\nThinking it was an earthquake, the salesman ran out of the building. When he saw Bert, he asked him for a cigarette. \"I quit smoking last month,\" he said to Bert. Bert told him about the fallen bodies. They both walked over to look at the corpses. Bert told the salesman how sad he felt for the dead people and their families.\nAfter a short pause, the salesman said, \"You know, we can fix this Camaro for you. It'll look like new.\"\n\"Really? For how much?\" Bert asked.\n\"Not much, not much at all,\" the salesman replied.\nJust then, a police car, a fire truck, and an ambulance pulled up. A police officer told Bert and the salesman to move away from the wreckage, but to stick around for questioning.",

Plastic doesn't give you bad breath.\"\nHannah asked him if he had ever used a public phone right after some stranger had talked on it. \"The plastic phone stinks from their breath,\" she said. \"Why do you always have to argue with me?\" He told her that he didn't argue with her—she was the one who always argued with him.\nElmer saw his dentist a week later. He asked if veneers could cause bad breath. The dentist told him that it was possible, because plastic can retain odor. He said a more common cause of bad breath from dental work was fillings. Several patients had come to him because they thought they had gotten bad breath from new fillings. He replaced the fillings with different material, and their bad breath went away.\n\"Well, should I get veneers for my two front teeth?\" Elmer asked. \"I used to have tiny chips in each tooth. Now, those chips are bigger.\"\nHis dentist told him that applying veneers would require destroying too much enamel, which the two teeth were already deficient in. \"I'll bet you used to suck on lemons,\" he said. Elmer nodded.\nHis dentist suggested grinding down the chipped areas a little bit so that their edges wouldn't be so jagged. The grinding, accompanied by a burning odor, took only a couple of minutes. When Elmer ran his tongue over his \"new\" teeth, they felt nice and smooth. So he decided that the $100 dentist bill was probably worth it. More importantly, he wouldn't have to worry about losing his girlfriend because of a couple of veneers.",

        "grade": 4.5,
        "text": "Chelsea was a saleswoman. She worked for a medical equipment manufacturer to sell medical equipment to hospitals. She drove all over Los Angeles County five days a week. She was not the world's most law‐abiding driver. When all the freeway lanes were at a dead stop, she would scoot along the emergency lane. She rarely met a stop sign at an empty intersection that she obeyed. She usually slowed down enough to make sure the intersection was clear, and then zipped on through. She usually talked on her cell phone while driving. While driving and yakking, she would often drink a soda or eat a sandwich. Her hands, legs, and mouth were always busy while she was driving. She was born, she often bragged, to multitask.\nOne Friday afternoon Chelsea had to show a customer how to operate a new device. The customer was a slow learner, so Chelsea ended up leaving the hospital half an hour later than she had planned. Then, of course, she got stuck in Friday evening rush hour. She was going to be late for her date, but the nearby mountains blocked her cell phone from calling Sebastian and telling him.\nShe was already irritated, and things seemed to be getting worse. Then all the traffic stopped. Chelsea drove immediately over to the emergency lane and continued driving along it. She was making good progress. She couldn't believe she was the only one in the emergency lane. Usually several cars would follow her lead. Then she saw the red flashing lights in her rearview mirror. The officer pulled her over and walked up alongside her car. He was young and good‐looking. Chelsea felt better.\n\"Do you know why I pulled you over, ma'am?\"\n\"Yes, officer. I'm illegally in the emergency lane.\"\n\"Is there a reason that you are in the emergency lane?\"\n\"Officer, my husband left me for another woman. I'm pregnant. I have morning sickness day and night. I'm just trying to get to the nearest drugstore to buy my medicine.\" She looked at him imploringly, with big, sweet, innocent eyes.\nHe looked at her for a long moment, then handed her license back.\n\"Okay, ma'am. Take the first exit you come to. I hope you'll be feeling better. I'm Anthony, by the way.\"\n\"Thank you so much, Officer Anthony.\"\nThe officer walked back to his car and Chelsea drove on. This was the second time that excuse had worked for her. She had one more errand to do before she got home. She had to mail a package. She got to the mini‐mall at 7 p.m. No parking was available, except for the handicapped space. Chelsea whipped right into it. She would only be a minute, she told herself. All she had to do was run into the mailbox store, get the package weighed, and pay the clerk.\nThere was no line in the store. Everything was done so quickly that she was whistling while she walked back out to her car. Then she stopped whistling. There was an envelope on the windshield. She opened it slowly. She knew what it was, but not how much it was. She screamed when she saw the amount. A dog started barking."

        "name": "Christmas Pineapples for All",
        "grade": 4.5,
        "text": "It was a sunny, cool Christmas Day in Sheepshead Bay. Dom had just gotten off the Q train. He started walking back to his apartment. He approached the fruit and vegetable market at 17th Street and Avenue Z. Outside was a huge stack of pineapples. They were $1.50 each, or two for $2. What a deal, Dom thought.\nThen an idea struck him. Why not buy a pineapple for each neighbor in my corner of the building, he thought. He was new in the building. He didn't know a single neighbor. Giving them a pineapple on Christmas Day might generate some communication.\nSo he bought six pineapples—one for each of his five neighbors, and one for himself. He carried home six plastic bags containing six fresh, delicious Hawaiian pineapples. When he got to his floor, he quietly placed a pineapple in front of each of his neighbors' doors.\nHe opened his door. He was about to take his pineapple inside and slice it open when he had another thought. If his neighbors saw no pineapple in front of his door, they would assume that he had bought the pineapples. They might be grateful, or they might think that he thought he was a big shot because he had given them a pineapple. Or, they might feel resentful because now they \"owed\" him a thank you or maybe even a gift in kind.\nHe decided it was better that his pineapples be anonymous gifts. He left his pineapple just to the side of his door. He'd collect it later. Five hours later, he opened his door. He looked at his neighbors' doors. All the pineapples were gone. He looked down. So was his! 4.5, 284"

About 10,000 people die every year in America. They are killed by drunk drivers. Drunk drivers kill about 30 people every day. Thirty people. Every day. Is this in the news? Is this on the radio? Is this on national TV? Year after year, this doesn't make the national news. But the national news people are concerned about bad brakes. They don't want bad brakes to kill another person.

The biker turned his head and shouted \"Bikes only, moron!\" and disappeared from view. Kane was walking on a mountain bike trail. He had already seen a sign saying Bikers Only, but he had figured that the trail in the woods was wide enough for him and for the bikers.\nThis was public land. Who were bikers to hog this trail for themselves, he thought. Where was he supposed to take his nature walks—through the spider webs and the underbrush? And who did that biker think he was, to call Kane a name? The more he thought, the angrier he got. He'd fix them.\nThe next Saturday, he visited the trail again, but this time with a shovel. It was an old GI shovel that he still had from his Army days. It was small but efficient. He found a slight curve in the trail and, just after sunrise, he started digging. He dug a ditch all the way across the bike trail. The ditch was four inches deep and twelve inches wide. He would have liked to hang around and watch the action, but there was no place to conceal himself. Maybe later he could set up one of those spy cameras people use for home security, he thought as he walked back to his car. Then he could upload the really good crashes to the Internet.\nAn hour later, a 15‐year‐old girl hit the ditch. She flew through the air and landed among some small trees. Because she was wearing a helmet, knee pads, and elbow pads, all she suffered were bruises, scratches, and a sprained wrist. Her $700 bike was moderately damaged. She used her cell phone to call her dad. Despite her soreness, she stood guard on the trail to warn others.\nPolice investigated the scene of the \"accident.\" An officer said if they caught who dug the ditch, the culprit would be charged with felony vandalism, which might result in a year in prison.",

Bob's Liquors was at the corner, halfway to the beach. It was the only store within a mile. It sold cold beer and cigarettes, which were the only two things that interested Pete today. The owner of Bob's was Bill. Bill had bought the store from Bob, but never renamed the store. \"'Bob's' has a nice ring to it,\" he told curious customers. Also, of course, keeping the old name saved him money, time, and trouble.\nWhen the water was unsafe, the lifeguards would put red flags all up and down the beach to warn swimmers to stay out of the water. Today was a red flag day. Fierce riptides and lots of jellyfish were predicted for the next 48 hours.\nAlthough windy and completely overcast, it was a warm September day. Pete stopped at Bob's. Bill said hello and told Pete to be careful because of the riptide reports. He asked, \"What'll it be today, Pete?\"\nPete ordered the usual—a pack of cigarettes and beer. Bill put the six‐pack into a double paper bag because that helped keep the beer cold longer. Pete paid him and said goodbye. He walked out the door and crossed the two‐lane street, not bothering to look in either direction.\nThe flags were flapping loudly. Small waves were splashing onto the beach. Sea gulls were walking at water's edge. Low thunder rumbled occasionally in the distance. An irregular line showed where wet sand met dry sand. Pete sat down on the dry sand. He opened a can of beer and lit a cigarette. There was no one else at the beach, except a woman walking away from him, stopping frequently to examine seashells. Pete watched a pelican dive into the water. Far away on the horizon, a stationary ship floated.\nPete was a strong swimmer. He had learned to swim when he was four years old. In grade school and high school, he won numerous swimming and diving tournaments. His parents had high hopes that he would compete in the Olympics.\nPete opened the fifth beer and lit yet another cigarette. The woman collecting seashells had disappeared from sight. He got up and walked into the water. When the water was almost thigh‐high, he felt the current tugging at him. A jellyfish stung him behind his right knee. He took a final drag on his cigarette and flicked it into the water. He finished the beer, filled the empty can with sea water, and threw it back onto the beach. He looked at the ship.

The book was one of seven that he had piled up yesterday. He was going to buy all of them. But at the last moment, he changed his mind. He put all seven back on the shelf.\nSamuel had a personal library at home that exceeded 1,000 books, almost all unread. He subscribed to seven magazines and one daily newspaper. Samuel had more reading material in his small apartment than he could finish in two lifetimes, yet his urge to buy more books raged on.\nHe finally put his foot down. Not one more book, he told himself, unless it is really special. Yesterday's book fit the bill. It was a biography of one of his favorite authors, Stephen King. King is one of America's most popular fiction authors. But it wasn't easy for King; early in his career, he got hundreds of rejection slips. Samuel wanted to be a great writer.

Ten days later, the lab confirmed his suspicions.\nHannah's doctor said he could treat her with chemotherapy and painkillers, but it was just a matter of time before the cancer killed her.

Because it was the weekend, there was only one car available—an SUV. Patricia was an environmentalist. SUVs, which are big cars consuming a lot of gasoline, offended her greatly.\nBut she needed something to get to Baker, a town that was 100 miles from the small airport. So she went to RentMe instead. \"I need a car for 48 hours,\" she said, \"and I don't want an SUV. I want something small and cheap.\" They told her they had just the vehicle for her, a 1998 Fiat. It was only thirty dollars a day, including insurance and other incidental fees. All she had to do was pay for her own gasoline. Patricia was very pleased. Thirty dollars a day was a good rate even for a weekday. She signed all the paperwork, and they gave her the keys.\nThe Fiat was a 4‐speed, 4‐cylinder, 2‐door beauty. The paint, tires, and interior were like new. It was comfortable, even though the air‐conditioner was not the frostiest. She got in and drove north. It was a two‐lane road all the way to Baker, with only one town between the airport and Baker. That town was Norris, 40 miles from Baker.\nPatricia didn't make it to Norris. The car refused to run 30 minutes after she had been driving it. Fortunately, her cell phone was able to connect back to the RentMe desk. \"My car stopped running, and I'm out here in the middle of nowhere in the hot sun!\" she said.\n\"That doesn't make any sense,\" said the clerk. \"You did put gas in the car before you left town, didn't you?\"\n\"No, of course not!\" yelled Patricia. \"Why would I put gas in the car before I even got out of town?\"\n\"Well, why do you think you got such a good rate? We save money by having the customer gas up instead of us having to put gas in the car.\"\n\"I was in a hurry,\" said Patricia.\n\"Well, sometimes you pay a price for being in a hurry,\" said the clerk. \"We'll send a man out with some spare gas for you, if you'd like.\"\n\"Of course I'd like,\" said Patricia. \"How long will it be?\"\nThe clerk told her it would be within the hour. He didn't tell her that there would be a $50 service charge for delivering the gas, or that the five gallons of fuel would cost her $7 a gallon. She would get that bad news when she returned the car to the airport in Cityville."

Emily asked a stranger to take their picture. The stranger took their picture. It was out of focus. Emily asked another stranger to take their picture. It was also out of focus. Grant asked a stranger to take their picture. The picture was crystal clear. It was a beautiful picture. \"The third time's the charm,\" said Grant, smiling."

For one thing, the all you can eat buffets were $15, instead of $3. And traffic was much worse, of course. But now Las Vegas had a monorail that stopped at all the major hotels. No more walking in the hot sun (or the bitterly cold wind, if you visited Las Vegas in the winter). Jasper's dad loved the buffets. \"Even at $15, he'll still eat $20 or $30 worth,\" Jasper's mom said.\nJasper asked his dad what games he was going to play. Blackjack, he replied, if he could find a $2 table. Jasper told him that he might have to go downtown to a real old casino. Most casinos, he said, require a $5 minimum nowadays. That didn't surprise his dad. After he lost a hundred dollars, he was finished anyway, he said. He was never one to throw good money after bad.\nJasper's mom had no use for anything except slot machines. She loved the slots, as long as she could find nickel machines and dime machines. \"Are any of those left?\" she asked Jasper. He said he wasn't sure, but there had to be some, somewhere. She said she was going to play differently on this visit: she would wait till someone used a machine for at least 15 minutes. Then she would play that machine when that person got up and left. Maybe, she hoped, the jackpot would hit on the first nickel that she put in.\nThat's a good idea, Jasper thought. Unfortunately, it's the same trick that everyone who plays the slot machines does. And almost everyone goes home broke.",

The termite inspector was coming on Monday. Owen wanted the inspector to be able to \"inspect\" without tripping over boxes, books, fishing rods, and golf clubs.\nOwen was going to reward himself with a late afternoon bicycle ride. He enjoyed riding or walking through his neighborhood with its many beautiful houses, yards, and trees. But first, he had to inflate both bike tires. He got out a hand air pump he had bought at a thrift shop for only $2. The pump nozzle adapter didn't fit onto the bike's valve stem. Nothing is ever simple, he thought.\nHe looked for his new pump, the one that had cost $10. It had all the bells and whistles: high volume air flow on both up and down strokes, quick lock valve adapter and four nozzle adapters, air gauge, and footplate for easy pumping. It was a beauty. Of course, Owen couldn't find it. I've got everything, but I can't find anything, Owen muttered.\nAs usual, Owen did find one thing while he was looking for another thing. He found another used pump that he had been looking for a month ago. It was a big, heavy, steel pump that had an air gauge and a small leak somewhere. Owen connected the pump to the rear tire. He started pumping. The \"small\" leak seemed to have gotten bigger. Owen stopped counting after the first 80 pumps; finally, the dial hit 65 psi. He was huffing and puffing. He went to the refrigerator and got a diet soda. After finishing it, he pumped up the front tire. Sweat dripped from his forehead. That was a good workout, he thought, as he finished off a second soda. He screwed the valve stem caps back on. He stood back and admired his \"new\" tires proudly.\nThe bike was now ready to ride. Owen, however, felt a little tired. Plus, he was hungry. In fact, it looked like it was getting too dark for a long ride. There's always tomorrow, he thought as he opened the refrigerator door. The chilled air felt good.",

It needed new windshield wiper blades. \"How much are the blades?\" Darwin asked. Andy said $12.

Andy said only if it had a burnt odor.\n\"We can't find a leak in that tire,\" Andy said. \"Oh, one more thing—I strongly recommend a new battery.\"\n\"But that's a DieHard, and it's still got two years left on its 100‐month warranty,\" Darwin said.\n\"That battery is over six years old,\" Andy said. \"You're already on borrowed time.

Denise was Gilroy's mom and Darwin's girlfriend. He asked how much the new battery would be. \"$137.46,\" Andy said. Yikes, Darwin thought.\n\"So what would that bring the total price to?\" he asked.\n\"$593.74,\" Andy said.\nAlthough Darwin had been hoping for a $300 bill, he told Andy to go ahead. Andy said he'd call later. If there were no glitches, the Buick would be ready by 5 p.m. I hope there's no glitches, Darwin thought, because I can't afford any.",

Whatever she was going to give him, it was definitely going to be a surprise. She had not asked him whether he wanted anything, and he had not dropped any hints suggesting that he was hoping for something. In fact, his plan was simply to watch TV and ignore the event. There was certainly nothing interesting or exciting about turning 32.\nWhen he got home from work, he changed into his shorts and a T‐shirt and took their dog Pretty Boy for a walk. When he returned, Amanda had also gotten home from work. She gave him a kiss and told him happy birthday. He thanked her and asked what the surprise was. She told him that it was on the pillow in the bedroom. He went into the bedroom and found a brightly wrapped package with a big blue bow on it. He brought it out to the living room.\n\"Why don't you try to guess what it is?\" Amanda suggested.\n\"Okay,\" Perry replied. \"It's not a motorcycle or a houseboat. It's not my Christmas bonus. It's not another pet; I don't see any air holes in the wrapping and I don't hear any sounds.\"\n\"Well, maybe it's a turtle,\" Amanda smiled.\n\"Yes, that would explain the silence, but turtles still need to breathe,\" Perry said. \"It's not a book or a video or a CD, is it?\"\n\"No, you're not even close. Remember, it's something special.\"\n\"Well, you've got me,\" Perry said, puzzled. Something special in a box that was only about one cubic foot. He told Amanda that he gave up. She told him to unwrap the box. After opening it, all he found was a little rubber doll.\n\"What's this?\" he asked.\n\"It's our first baby, silly. I'm pregnant!\" Amanda beamed."

A hooded figure got out of the passenger side of a black Mustang. He walked right up to her. She clutched her purse. He punched her. She fell to the pavement, stunned. The man grabbed her purse. She held tight, until he kicked her in her side. She screamed in pain and let go of her purse. The man yelled something at her and got back into the Mustang. She heard laughter as it drove off.\nA minute later, another car pulled up. A woman got out and asked Janelle what was wrong. Janelle was crying. The woman called the police, and helped Janelle to her feet. A police car arrived about 10 minutes later. The officer called for an ambulance, but Janelle said to forget it.

Mark ignored the solid, yellow line and passed the truck. It was 11:40 when he got to the parking lot. He walked quickly to the clubhouse to tell Mel, the assistant pro, that he had arrived.\nMel said, \"We're running about 10 minutes behind, so you're okay. But Barney just called. He said there was a fatal accident on the freeway. The highway patrol closed his side of the freeway. He said to go on without him; he's going back home.\"",

Fifty minutes after the funeral mass had begun, Mike took his place at the lectern near the altar. He began, \"Fr. Dave gave me only five minutes to praise Dad. Frankly, it would take me five hours to do him justice.\" Then, looking at his audience, he began to talk lovingly about his dad. Ten minutes later, as Mike was nearing his finish, he heard the priest, behind Mike and to his left, start talking loudly about Mike's dad. Startled, Mike turned around, looked at Fr.

Ten minutes later, after finally getting the waiter's attention, Hank and Nathan each ordered a small salad, a double cheeseburger with chips, and a couple of beers. Alvin asked the waiter if he had worked there long. \"Long enough,\" the waiter replied. When he returned with the beers, Nathan told the waiter thanks. The waiter said nothing in reply.\n\"Did you see that?\" Alvin asked. \"You said thanks, and he didn't bother to say you're welcome.\" Hank said that younger people today were not taught the finer points of etiquette.\n\"The 'finer points'?!\" Alvin said. \"The finer points are knowing which side of the plate the forks and spoons are supposed to be on. Knowing when to say sir, thank you, and you're welcome is elementary etiquette.\" The waiter came back to clear the plates from the table. Nathan hadn't quite finished, but said nothing. When the waiter brought the bill about ten minutes later, Alvin motioned to him.\n\"Give me the bill,\" he said. \"I'm going to treat my friends.\" Wordlessly, the waiter placed the bill in front of Alvin.\nNathan and Hank were astounded. \"You know,\" said Nathan, \"this might be the first time I've ever seen you pick up the tab. What's the occasion?\" Alvin told Nathan that he just felt like being nice to his friends for a change. The bill was $20. After his friends had left the table, Alvin put a 35‐cent tip on the table.",

        "text": "It was 10 p.m. Fritz said good night to his wife. She was watching TV. He went to bed. Tomorrow was a big day. It was his last day of work. Thirty years with the federal government. Thirty years of flying out of town for weeks on end. Thirty years of interviews, meetings, and heavy briefcases. Tomorrow it would all be over. Not that he didn't like it. He had enjoyed his career.\nFritz felt blessed. His father had had a tough life as an unskilled laborer. Whenever Fritz was a bit discouraged or upset, he thought about his overworked and underpaid father. He thanked God for his own good life, and for the fact that he had been able to make his dad's last years comfortable.\nHis two children were married and had their own careers. His wife Paige kept busy with, among other things, her bridge club. She had tried to get him interested in bridge, but without success. Fritz was content with his own Friday night poker group.\nFriday morning, he went to work for the very last time. Those who knew him well would miss him. Fritz was a genuinely nice guy. He never had a bad word to say about anyone. Some people might have thought he was a little dull, but he was intelligent, a hard worker, and a team player. He had taken only three weeks of sick leave in 30 years.\nA small group took him out to lunch. When he returned from lunch, the whole office gathered around for cake, ice cream, a farewell card, and a few short speeches. They presented him with various going‐away gifts, including a big, paperback U.S. atlas. It listed all the motels, campgrounds, national parks, tourist spots, and other information to help guide a leisurely traveler throughout the good old USA. He had told his friends that he and Paige were going to spend a couple of years visiting all the places that he never had gotten to explore while there on business. As a final gift, his supervisor told him to take the rest of the day off.\nPaige's car wasn't in the driveway when he got home. She was probably shopping for some traveling clothes. Maybe she was out arranging a dinner at a restaurant that evening for just the two of them. That would be nice.\nBut something was wrong. When he hung up his jacket, he saw that the bedroom closet was half empty. Paige's clothes were gone. Her shoes were not on the closet floor. Confused, he looked around the bedroom.\nHe saw an envelope on the lamp stand. Inside it were two pieces of paper. One notified him of a divorce proceeding. The other was a handwritten note from Paige. \"I'm so sorry,\" it began. She said that her lawyer had told her to wait until today. If she had sought divorce a year earlier, like her boyfriend had suggested, she would not have been able to qualify for 50 percent of Fritz's pension. She hoped that he would find it in his heart to forgive her. She felt terrible about this, she wrote, because \"you've been so good to me. But I can't ignore my own heart.\"\nFritz sat immobile on the edge of the bed. Her note was in his hand; her words were burning in his brain.\nMaybe an hour later, the phone rang. He picked it up on the fifth ring. It was Bob, reminding Fritz it was his turn to bring the chips and dip.",

Brevyn, a high school grad, said that nobody ever noticed anyway.\nBrevyn knew that Simon was \"book smart,\" but he didn't think Simon was very \"street smart.\" Years ago, Simon had bought stereo speakers from a street vendor. When he arrived home, he called Brevyn over to help him set up the speakers. Simon was excited because he had gotten the speakers at half price. The brand new speaker boxes said Panasonic, Model No. A‐682ST, Made in Japan.\nBut Simon was disappointed and angry when he discovered that the boxes contained only old magazines. Brevyn was amused. \"Did you get a receipt?\" Brevyn asked. \"Did you ask the guy about his return policy? Did he tell you where his 'store' is going to be tomorrow?\"\nBrevyn visited Simon to show him the new tires he had just put on his Honda Accord. While they were talking in Simon's living room, Simon showed Brevyn an air pump he had recently purchased. \"If your new tires ever go low, you can pump them up super-fast with this. It pumps air into the tire on the downstroke and the upstroke,\" Simon said.\nBrevyn said, \"You must be kidding. I've never heard of a pump that pumps air on the upstroke.\" Brevyn tried out the pump. \"There's no air coming out of here on the upstroke,\" he told Simon.\n\"Of course there is. Read the label on the pump.\"\nBrevyn read the label. \"Ha! Listen to this: 'High volume air flow on both up and down strokes.' The air 'flows,' all right, but it flows in on the upstroke, not out. The label writer tricked you, Mr. English Major. What have you got to say for yourself?\"\n\"Let's go outside,\" Simon said. \"Maybe I can find a small nail in one of your new tires.\"",

The towel that covered the leather seat had a couple of small red flowers sitting in a crease. The flowers appeared as she straightened out the towel before she sat down. She always straightened out the towel before sitting down, because Logan sometimes left his glasses, pen, or other items on the passenger seat. She didn't want to break anything by sitting on it, nor did she want to injure herself by sitting on something sharp.\n\"What flowers?\" Logan asked.\n\"These flowers!\" she said sharply, holding the two little flowers up to his nose. He said he didn't know. He said he thought they had been there for quite a while. No, they hadn't, she told him, as she put them into a tissue and then put the tissue in her purse. They weren't there two days ago when she had last been in his car. Maybe they had been there, but she hadn't seen them, he suggested.\n\"Maybe you're lying! Who did you buy flowers for?\" she yelled at him. This was not the first time she had \"caught\" him cheating on her. She had never really caught him, of course, because he had never cheated on her. It was a little game she liked to play, just to remind Logan not to cheat.\n\"Well? Who did you buy these flowers for?\" she asked again. He was trying to think. He was sure he had seen the flowers lying there for days, but he had no idea where they had come from.\nHe told her that he had driven for a while yesterday with all the windows open, to freshen the car. \"You know how windy it was yesterday. Maybe the flowers got blown into the car.\"\n\"Ha!\" she snorted. \"If I ever catch you even thinking about cheating on me, we're through! Got it?\"\nOn the one hand, Logan was too much in love with Anita to ever cheat on her. On the other, when she got bossy like this, he did think, however fleetingly, about moving on.",

He definitely had an attitude, Rudy thought. Rudy ordered an extra‐large orange juice and an extra‐large latte. A few minutes later, the young man placed them on the counter and said, \"Eight dollars.\"\nRudy asked for a small cup of water with ice.

But his lawyer argued that death by injection was painful. He argued that Henry shouldn't suffer in his final moments. The California Supreme Court agreed. The court said that the lethal drugs might make Henry suffer. Such suffering would be \"cruel and unusual\" punishment. Such punishment violates the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\nHenry remains in his comfortable cell. He watches TV. He reads books, magazines, and newspapers. He listens to music. Henry will die only if California figures out how to kill him painlessly.\nThe family of the murdered girl is upset. Her dad said, \"He'll probably die of old age in his sleep.

As the license plate on his car said, he was The Boss.\nCalifornia is an \"at will\" state.

He can smell a rose, but he cannot tell if it is red, white, or blue. It does not matter to him; he enjoys the beauty of the scent itself.\nPeople sometimes take pity on him, but he tells them he is a contented man. He does not feel cheated by Mother Nature. The doctors never figured out why he was born blind.\nBut his life is not a bed of roses. It is difficult for him to travel. He cannot drive, of course; he travels by bus. At home, he cannot just look out the window to see what the weather is like, and then dress appropriately. He can't look at the clock on the wall to see what time it is. He uses his Braille watch or a special radio for that.\nHe must always put everything in the same spot in his apartment. If he doesn't, \"I'll spend forever looking for it,\" he laughs.\nPhilip can look for and look at, but he cannot see. He says strangers often correct themselves when talking to him. They'll say, \"I see,\" meaning \"I understand.\" But then they think they've been rude, so they'll correct themselves and say, \"I mean, I understand.\"\nPhilip has never seen a good movie or a bad TV show. He has no idea what a sunset or a full moon looks like. He is a musician. He plays the saxophone, but not in a band. Four times a week, he travels to Old Town in Pasadena on the bus in the afternoon. He gets off at the bus stop and then finds his way across the street to The Cap, a hat store. On the sidewalk in front of The Cap is his \"spot.\"\nHe unfolds an aluminum chair and assembles his sax after taking it out of the case. He sits down and starts warming up. He puts a hat, upside down with change in it, on top of the case. \"The change keeps the hat from blowing away,\" he says. \"It also lets people know where to put their donations. I usually spend about four hours here. I'll earn from $10 to $30. One evening I made almost $100. Another evening, someone stole everything. I guess he needed it more than I did.\"\nWhen asked how he counts the bills, Philip said, \"That's why a blind person always needs a sighted friend.\" 3.9, 430"

The whole Earth was as dark as the inside of an inner tube. Flashlights, car lights, and streetlights did not brighten the blackness. A bright light appeared in the sky for all to see.\nA voice said, \"We've been watching you. You are a world of bullies. You need to learn to be nice to your neighbors. We're going to start with world leaders, then work our way down the power ladder. We're going to take the H‐A‐T‐E out of E‐A‐R‐T‐H. We're going to replace 'hatred' and 'hurtful' with 'nice.' If you bully others, you'll suffer horribly and publicly.\" Then the light went out, and the sun reappeared over half the Earth's surface.\nSome world leaders scoffed. They didn't believe the light had any power, other than to turn the entire sky black or blue. One world leader, Darth, the world's most feared and most macho leader, immediately attacked the country that was his western neighbor. The attack lasted all of five minutes. Then Earth's entire sky went black and the light reappeared. Dangling in the light for all to see was Darth. Suddenly, he started screaming. After about half a minute, he stopped.\nHe begged, \"Please, don't hurt me again. I'm sorry! I'll never do that again.\" Then he started screaming again. This time his screaming made dogs bark and cats howl. Finally, Darth stopped screaming. He begged and promised some more. The light released Darth back to Earth.\nFrom then on, there were no more wars. National leaders worked out their problems through conversation and compromise. Ordinary people started doing likewise.\nEvery year for the next 20 years, the light reappeared. It congratulated leaders and followers on their improved behavior, but it reminded them, \"We see all of you all of the time.\" Then a replay of Darth screaming in agony appeared for a full minute, and the light disappeared.\nIn the 21st year, the light failed to appear. One of the first to notice this was Darth."

She said, \"You know, you're the first person to say anything about that.\" He couldn't believe it. He asked how many people had bought the book. She said 1,500 people had bought it. \"And I'm the only one to complain?\" he asked. She said yes. He asked how many people had returned the book. She said nobody had returned it. He couldn't believe it. \"I circled 215 misspellings in the book,\" he said, \"and there are only 200 pages!\" Cheryl said, \"Maybe we should submit it to Guinness.\" 3.8"

He was looking at a big, red, dry stain that was on the carport where he always parked his car.\nThere was only one thing to do: check his power steering fluid and his transmission fluid, both of which were red. The power steering fluid was at the proper level, so that left the transmission fluid. A small leak could result in a damaged transmission, which could cost $1,000 to $2,000 to repair or replace. Denzel did not have $1,000 or $2,000.\nDenzel was not sure about how to check his transmission fluid level. But he found the instructions in his car manual. They were not complicated.\nHe ran his engine for about 15 minutes to get it up to normal operating temperature. Next, he shifted the transmission through all the gears and then let the car idle for three minutes in park. Then he pulled out the dipstick. The fluid was at the correct level. Denzel breathed a sigh of relief.\nAs he drove off in his car, he wondered if he would ever find out the cause of that stain. Or would it be one of those mysteries of life, like the mystery of why his last girlfriend had left him.\n\"Why did you break up with me?\" he had asked her on the phone a while ago. \"I thought everything was going well between us. Then, wham, out of nowhere, you told me we were through. You needed more space, you said. What does that mean?\"\n\"It's a long story,\" she replied.\n\"Go ahead,\" he said. \"I've got plenty of time.\"\n\"I've got to go,\" she said.\n\"Women!\" Denzel muttered as the phone went dead.",

It was a 3‐hour meeting, from 7 to 10 p.m. Lecturers talked on various subjects. Each talk was followed by a question and answer period. It was an informal, pleasant evening.\nThe evening always began with a delicious dinner catered by a local restaurant. This year's host was a Middle Eastern restaurant. Teachers piled as much as they wanted on their paper plates and found a seat outdoors or in the auditorium. Most teachers really seemed to appreciate the food.\nFor Shane, this evening was his opportunity to check out the female teachers. This year, a beauty walked into the auditorium about 10 minutes late. She sat in the row in front of Shane, just two seats away. Shane couldn't believe it. She was not only the best‐looking woman in the auditorium, but she smiled at him before she sat down. She was tall and had long, red hair. She was wearing a sexy, black cocktail dress.\nShane could not focus on the meeting anymore. He looked at the lecturers less than he looked at the redhead. He was enveloped in her perfume. She took notes right‐handed. She ran her fingers through her hair. She crossed and uncrossed her legs. Shane was going crazy. Plus, there was no ring on her left hand.\nThe meeting ended. The dean thanked everyone for attending. Everybody applauded the presenters. The redhead stood up. Shane stood up. She smiled at him, and then walked out. Shane walked out. She went to the restroom. Shane waited. When she came out, he walked up to her.\n\"Hi,\" he smiled. \"My name's Shane. I was wondering if you have time for a cup of coffee. I was hoping we could share some of our teaching experiences.\"\nShe smiled. \"Why, thank you. That's sweet of you. I appreciate your offer, but I've got to get home. My husband is babysitting tonight, and I'm sure he's pretty tired. Maybe another time?\" She smiled, and walked away.",

Aside from some photos, the clock was the only memento Andy had of his mom and dad.\nHis father died of cancer in 1964. Then his mom moved to a private nursing home. She had many friends there. The nursing home, however, went bankrupt. They moved her into a state nursing home. She hated it there.\nShe asked Andy to help her move into a private nursing home again. She had spent most of her husband's savings on living expenses at the first nursing home. Andy said he would try.\nBut Andy had no savings. He was a sergeant in the Army, and all his money went to his wife and three kids. He called his older brother Frank, who was single and had a great job. Frank was an avid deep‐sea fisherman and was interested in buying a large boat for weekend use.\n\"Frank, I don't have the money now, but you do,\" Andy pleaded. \"Just pay for mom and I'll owe you for half of the nursing home costs.\"\n\"You'll owe me? You don't have two nickels to rub together, and probably never will. I'll get stuck for the whole bill. What about my boat?\"\n\"What boat?\"\n\"Never mind. Let me think about it, and I'll get back to you.\"\nFrank never did send his mom the money to move into a private nursing home. Alone and unhappy, she died in the state nursing home only a year later. Andy never forgave his brother.\nMany years went by. Frank's health declined. He called up Andy one day. \"Andy, I feel really bad about not helping out mom. I was too interested in getting that boat. The older I've gotten, the more guilt I feel. My days are numbered, Andy. I was wondering if you would send me that clock, just for a little while. I want to beg mom to forgive me.\"\nAndy was very reluctant to part with his clock, but he did feel a little sorry for Frank. Frank died ten months later. One of Frank's nieces, Flo, was the executor of his estate. Flo had hired a lawyer to help her Uncle Frank rewrite his will in his dying days. Strangely enough, Flo got everything.\nShe made sure Uncle Frank was buried a day after his death. No announcement was made about his funeral, which Flo kept private. At the 20‐minute service, Flo was the only \"mourner.\" Flo sold Uncle Frank's house, car, and boat within the week. Everything of lesser value went to a charity. His cash and stocks, of course, were already safely in her name.\nWhen Andy discovered that his brother had died, he called Flo to ask about his clock.\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"that went to charity with everything else. You didn't really want that old thing, did you, Uncle Andy? Uncle Andy? Hello?\" Well, that was rude, she thought.",

Sidney thought that the original artist was actually Andy Williams. He told Gita that he had his doubts. She told him not to buy it, but he decided to take a chance on it—after all, it was only $11.99. What could they lose, he joked. When they got home and played the CDs in that set, both of them were disappointed.\n\"When are you going to learn to listen to me?\" Gita asked Sidney as she rapped him in the head with the box of the CD set. Sidney told her that he would take it back to see if he could exchange it. \"Of course not!\" Gita said. \"The receipt says that you cannot return an opened package.\"\nSidney took it back anyway. He hoped that he could charm the sales clerk into giving him an exchange; he couldn't. She said that the only thing she could do was buy the CD set back from him. He said that that was okay with him, figuring that she was going to pay him $11.99 plus tax. She typed the title of the set into her computer. A few moments later, she told him that she would be able to give him 70 cents. \"You mean seventy cents for each CD?\" Sidney asked.\n\"No, 70 cents for the set,\" she replied. Sidney laughed. He was getting ripped off by two different companies for the same item. On his way out of the store, he decided he would regift the set as an office Christmas present.",

The batter was actually out. The batter had grounded to the first baseman. He threw the ball to the pitcher covering first base. The ball beat the batter by half a step. It was a routine ground out.

Teddy called several times a week, just for a few minutes to say hello and see if everything was okay.

Hardly looking at the old man, she told Dana to get aboard her plane. She said the old man would be okay, and walked away.\nDana screamed for help. An airport supervisor appeared. He told Dana to get on the plane. Dana said that she was not moving until an ambulance arrived. The supervisor said her plane would leave without her. Dana said that she didn't care.\nAn ambulance and two paramedics finally arrived. The paramedics said that the man would be okay, but he would need stitches. They put him into the ambulance and drove off.\nOn her way out to the plane, which was still refueling, Dana saw the employee who had initially ignored the old man. The employee said, \"You're lucky the plane didn't leave without you.\"\n\"The plane?\" Dana asked. \"Who cares about the plane? How could you be so cold?

He smiled and told her that it was simple. All they needed were two gallons of white glossy paint, a roller, a tray and an insert to pour the paint in, and an extension‐handle to reach the high parts of each wall.\n\"Don't we need primer?\" Kenneth asked.\n\"Oh, yes, of course. I was getting to that. If you don't put primer on first, the paint won't stick to the walls. Here are two gallons of good, but inexpensive, primer. And a brush would be a good idea for use in the corners and edges. And that should take care of it. Just put the primer on first. Let it dry for a couple of hours. Then put on one coat of paint. Let it dry. Then, if you want to, put on another coat, but it shouldn't be necessary.\"\nAs they were putting the items into the trunk, Kenneth told her they should buy a ladder, too. \"We're going to have to use the brush to paint up near the ceiling. The roller won't do in a corner,\" Kenneth said.\n\"We don't need a stepladder. I can sit on your shoulders,\" Elizabeth laughed. They went back inside and bought a stepladder.",

Bradley got on the 210 freeway and headed northwest to where it meets the 5. Zach gave Bradley a few driving tips. Don't drive next to big rigs, because you never know when they might tip over and crush you. Don't drive behind pickup trucks with loads, because you never know when something in the truck will get airborne and come flying through your windshield.\nOn their way back, Zach suggested that they stop at the driving range. He wanted to show Bradley how to play golf. Bradley wasn't enthusiastic. He preferred his video games. But Bradley soon discovered that golf was fun! He hit a large bucket of balls. Zach told him that he had a natural swing. The next day Bradley, for the first time ever, called Zach. He had a few blisters on his hands; Zach said that was normal. Then Bradley asked if Zach would come by next Saturday so they could take a drive and hit golf balls again. Zach said of course, with a happy feeling in his heart.",

Sometimes the voice talks constantly. Sometimes it's quiet. Blair goes to a coffee shop every day. He drinks coffee and smokes cigarettes. He sits at a table by himself. Sometimes the voice talks to Blair about a stranger in the shop. The voice says, \"That man is thinking about you. He doesn't like you. He wants to fight.

Otherwise, he would have collided into the southbound traffic on Allen.\nAfter turning north on Allen, Webster stopped the car. \"What are you doing?! What are you doing?! You can't stop here—go, go, go! We're going to get rear‐ended! Get moving!\" Webster had stopped the car because he was confused and rattled. Noah's yelling certainly didn't help matters. Webster slowly accelerated.\nNoah told him to move to the right lane when it was safe. Webster turned on the signal, looked around at the right rear to make sure no one was in his blind spot, and got into the right lane. At Orange Grove, Webster  signaled again, and made a right turn. Noah told him to pull over to the curb. Webster parked the car.\n\"Webster, I'm sorry I yelled at you, but you cannot run a red light! When you're moving forward, you've always got to be looking at what's in front of you. You make a turn after you make sure the light or traffic permits you to. We could both be in the hospital right now. But we're okay, thank the Lord. And no cop was around, so we're double‐okay. So, let's just take a breather, and, when you're ready, we'll get back on the road. And from now on, when I say stop or brake, do so immediately!\"",

        "text": "Blair needed a break from the indoor life. Sometimes it seemed like he was in his apartment 24/7. He had recently found a perfect outdoor cure. It was a new coffeehouse on Foothill Boulevard that served 45 kinds of coffee and tea. He liked it because the coffee was good and the place was never overcrowded.\nThe coffeehouse was only a 10‐minute walk from his apartment. Blair took the walk. There were three female customers in the coffeehouse. None of them was young and pretty. Blair was a little disappointed. He preferred to see good‐looking women while he was drinking good‐tasting coffee.\nHe ordered a large \"coffee of the day,\" which was $1.70. He gave the clerk two dollars. He put the change in the tip jar and took his coffee outside. Blair preferred to drink outside. That way he could watch the traffic on the street. He liked to spot old Cadillacs that looked similar to his own.\nHe sat at a table under an umbrella, opened his book, and began reading. The book was a self‐improvement book. Blair had been reading it on and off for about two years. He hadn't noticed any improvement. A woman was approaching the patio. Blair looked up to see if she was attractive. She was. And she was by herself. He returned to the book as she passed by him. Blair kept looking at the pages, but his mind was on the woman.\nA few minutes later, she came outside holding a cup of coffee and sat at the table right next to Blair's. Her chair was so close to his that he could have reached over and touched her on her right shoulder. There were four other empty tables on the patio. Why had she sat at this one, so close to him? Was she looking for a boyfriend? Was she hoping that he would say hello?\nBlair went back to his book. But he wasn't reading the words—he was thinking about the woman. What could he say to her? How could he break the ice? What was a good line? \"What blend are you drinking?\" \"Your perfume smells nice.\" \"Weren't we in the same art class?\"\nBut maybe she wasn't interested in him at all. Maybe she just wanted to sit and drink in peace. Yet why would she sit so close to him? His thoughts were whirling around. He finally hit upon The Right Approach. As soon as she finished her drink, he'd ask her if he could treat her to another one. That would be a nice gesture on his part, and if she said No, then no harm, no foul. He'd go back to his book—but at a different table.\nJust then, her cell phone rang. She answered it, then laughed, then started talking animatedly. That's got to be her boyfriend, Blair thought.\nBut from the moment she had answered the phone, it didn't matter to Blair if she had a boyfriend or not, because she was speaking another language. Blair was not interested in a girl who didn't speak English. He went back to his book and his coffee. It tasted good, and his mind was clear."

A freshly killed calf was discovered lying in the middle of Arlington Drive at about 10:00 p.m. A witness, 20‐year‐old Emily Parker, said she saw the car hit the calf and keep going. She didn't see the driver, but she did recognize the hood ornament on the car—a pair of bull horns.\n\"Oh, yes,\" Emily said, \"I know that's the mayor's car. It's the only car in town with bull horns on the hood.\" Asked how she could see the bull horns at night, she replied, \"Oh, didn't you know? A couple of months ago the mayor got his horns neonized, so they have this soft, purple glow at night. They're really cool‐looking.\"\nThe sheriff drove over to the mayor's house, which is about five miles from city hall, and found the mayor washing his 1972 Kadillac. He asked why the mayor was washing his car so late at night. \"Because that's when there's no hot sun that causes the car to dry so fast that you have sun streaks. Don't you know anything, sheriff?\"\nThe sheriff pointed out that one of the horns was broken at the tip. \"When did that happen?\" he asked.\n\"When did what happen?\" Choi asked. \"Oh, good grief! I never even noticed that! Do you know how expensive these horns are? They don't grow on trees, you know. I wonder if I can find the missing piece and superglue it back on.\"\nThe sheriff then showed the mayor the tip of a bull horn. \"Do you think this is the missing piece?\"\nThe mayor was astounded. He looked at it, turned it over in his hands, and then placed it on the horn, where it fit perfectly. \"That's fantastic, sheriff! Thank you so much! Where did you find it?\"\n\"Where did I find it? It was next to Farmer Brown's calf that you killed back there about an hour ago.\"\nThe mayor's mouth dropped open. \"Calf! What calf? What are you talking about? I had no idea. I thought I hit a speed bump. What was his calf doing out in the middle of the road in the middle of the night? We'll settle this in court. I'm an innocent man. By the way, get that calf over to Lester's butcher shop right now. We'll have us a big barbecue tomorrow at city hall. And don't forget to invite Farmer Brown. I know he'll forgive me after he tastes Lester's world‐famous rib eye.\"",

Mrs. Neely owned the apartment building. She was an old lady who spoke with a thick Norwegian accent.\nJodie and Mrs. Neely got along very well. Mrs. Neely said that Jodie reminded her of her daughter, who had died in a car crash years ago. Mrs. Neely was a widow. She kept busy by volunteering at the local library and senior center. An excellent baker, she often brought bread and pastries to Jodie.\n\"You're trying to make me fat,\" laughed Jodie one day. \"How will I ever find a boyfriend?\"\n\"I still can't believe that Prince Charming hasn't found you,\" said Mrs. Neely. \"Maybe you're just too pretty and too smart for the young men around here.\"\nJodie was going to graduate school at night. She had a day job as a teacher's assistant in the fourth grade. She loved teaching kids. The principal had already told her that a full‐time teaching job was hers after she got her master's degree.\n\"Aren't there any nice boys in your graduate classes, Jodie?\" Mrs. Neely asked.\n\"There are some,\" said Jodie. \"But they're either married, or have a girlfriend, or are too focused on getting their degree. And don't forget, I have to concentrate on graduating, so I really shouldn't be dating anyway.\"\n\"Well, that's just a shame,\" said Mrs. Neely. \"You're too pretty to be alone. But don't worry. You keep doing your homework, and I'll be on the lookout for you.\" She winked at Jodie. Jodie smiled. She loved Mrs. Neely.\nMrs. Neely died not long after that conversation. She had a stroke while mixing some batter for cookies. An ambulance took her to the hospital, where she died a day later.\nHer son Ned was Mrs. Neely's sole heir. Ned had been married and divorced three times. None of his wives had anything nice to say about him. Ned didn't care. He was looking for Wife Number Four.\nNed introduced himself to Jodie right after Mrs. Neely's funeral on Saturday. He knew about Jodie because Mrs. Neely had told him about her. Ned said he was afraid that he might have to double her rent. Also, no pets were allowed in the building. \"You'll have to take your cat to the pound,\" he said.\n\"In that case,\" she said, \"I'm moving out.\"\n\"I was joking, of course. You're very pretty,\" said Ned.\n\"Thank you,\" said Jodie.\n\"Come to dinner with me at Chez Maison tonight and we can discuss your apartment and your cat.\" Ned had an air of confidence that Jodie found mildly attractive.\n\"That might be nice,\" she found herself saying. Ned told her he would pick her up at 8:00 and left. Jodie wondered if she was doing the right thing. She didn't even know this guy. Oh well, she thought, it would be nice to eat at a fancy restaurant for a change. She picked up some cat food on her way home.",

Their hours varied, so they didn't get to spend a whole lot of time together. But last weekend both were off work.\n\"Let's go to the beach,\" suggested Maria.\n\"That's a good idea,\" agreed Lisa. \"Which one?\"\n\"Well, I would prefer an uncrowded beach, because I think I've put on a few pounds recently. I don't want any boys seeing my fat.\"\n\"Oh, please,\" said Lisa. \"You eat so little. Ounces don't turn into pounds. How about Zuma Beach? That's pretty far north of Santa Monica Beach, so it's just right—not too crowded and not too empty.\"\n\"That sounds good,\" said Maria.\nThe drive to the beach took more than an hour. When they got there, the hot and sunny Hollywood weather had become cool, windy, and overcast beach weather. Both of them had been to the beach many times before, so they were not surprised by the change in weather. They put on their jackets, shoes, and socks, and headed north to hunt for seashells.\nWithin an hour they had collected about 20 beautiful shells into a plastic bag. They were still walking slowly north when they heard a roar. They turned around to see a four‐wheel All Terrain Vehicle coming rapidly toward them. The driver braked at the last moment. Sand flew onto the two girls. They both screamed.\nThe driver was wearing a jacket that said Beach Patrol. He got off the ATV and started yelling at them. \"What are you two doing here? Can't you read? The signs say Private Property. They say No Trespassing. Get out of here before I write you a ticket and have you arrested.\"\n\"What's your name?\" Maria stood defiantly. \"I'm going to report you to the police. You're not a real patrol officer. This is a public beach. Those signs are phony signs put up by homeowners who think they own the beach.\"\n\"My name is John Smith. Report me to whoever you want. Now get out of here or you'll be sorry.\"\n\"You can't make us leave. This is a public beach!\" yelled Maria.\nThe man got back onto his ATV and started driving in circles around the women. The ATV was spraying sand and water all over them. He was laughing. They started running back south. When the ATV driver saw that they were leaving, he drove off.\n\"John Smith. A phony name to go with a phony uniform,\" said Maria when they slowed down to a walk. \"We 're going to the police station and make a complaint. I hope they put him in jail.\"\nA few minutes later, Lisa asked, \"Where are the shells?\"\n\"Oh, gee, in all the excitement I left them back there. I'm sorry.\"\n\"No problem,\" replied Lisa. \"There's plenty of seashells in the sea.\"\n\"Yeah, just like there's plenty of jerks on the shore.\"",

He put on his jacket and ski cap, walked out to his car, and drove to her place.\nBecause she had just finished a difficult work project, Natalie was in a good mood. After they walked into Sonny's apartment, however, her mood seemed to change. Sonny pretended not to notice, but wondered what was going on. He took the chair, the scissors, and the hair clippers into the bathroom. She didn't help, as she usually did. He changed into a T‐shirt and shorts and sat down on the chair. \"I'm ready,\" he yelled out to her in the dining room. She didn't respond.\nHe walked out to the dining room. She was looking at ads in a magazine. \"Didn't you hear me?\" he asked. She gave him a look, and then told him that his apartment was as cold as the outdoors. Yikes, he thought. He apologized to Natalie, and turned on the central heat. But it was too late.",

Sugar was the sweetest thing this side of a candy store. She wouldn't hurt a fly. All these know‐nothings always bad‐mouth pit bulls, but if they'd met my Sugar, they'd want her young'uns.\"\nThe officer said, \"Well, you know 311 has received complaints about her barking for over a year.\"\nShe said, \"Yeah, Sugar barked a bit, but that was because she was happy. Besides, nobody'd shoot a dog just because it barked. Well, maybe a crazy person. Crazy people'll do anything. But, if you knock on enough doors, I'm sure you'll find the killer—and the real reason they shot poor Sugar. I'm going to have a funeral for her out back here. Would you like to come?

It's about 20 feet wide. Manhattan has many wide sidewalks. He can see several stores. One store is a clothing store. Two stores are shoe stores. A nearby building has a shiny silver smokestack. It's a tall skinny smokestack. It's 15 stories tall. Pigeons fly above the street. They land on building ledges. The ledges are beneath the windows. Two or three pigeons land on the same ledge. They sit there for a while. Then they fly away. Yesterday he saw a red balloon. It was as big as a soccer ball. It rose to his eye level. It quickly rose higher. In seconds it was gone. Where is it today, he wondered. Maybe it's floating over the cold, blue Atlantic."

They were only 15 miles from the stadium, but the heavy traffic on game day made those 15 miles seem more like 60 miles. It took about an hour to get to the stadium. Then, when the game was over, it took half an hour just to get out of the parking lot. Then the drive home was another hour. In other words, the traveling took longer than the game itself.\n\"Honey, the Giants are in town,\" Ilene said. \"I want to see Barry Bonds hit a home run. Can we go to the game? We haven't gone in such a long time.\"\n\"You're right. It has been a while. OK, I'll go if you don't mind driving,\" said Ralph.\n\"Great! Let's get ready. If we get there early enough, I might get his autograph. Maybe he'll hit a foul ball we can catch.\" Ilene was excited. We?, Ralph thought.\nAn hour later, they were in their car. They lived in Pasadena near an old church. They went south on Orange Grove and then south on the 110 freeway. The 110 is California's original freeway, full of twists and turns. Accidents occur daily. California drivers think yellow lights and sharp curves mean the same thing—speed up!\nThe traffic was lighter than they expected. They arrived at the stadium 40 minutes before game time. They paid the $8 parking fee, parked and locked the car, and walked to the main entrance.\nSeveral individuals were standing around outside the stadium, looking casual but actually selling tickets on the sly. \"Are you going to buy from a scalper?\" asked Ilene.\n\"Yes. Just like last time. That one looks honest,\" Ralph replied.\nThey walked over to a man in a red cap. Ralph's instincts were correct. The man had tickets for good seats at a fair price. Ralph gave the man $45 and thanked him.\n\"Don't thank me, my friend. Thank your local police department. Put your hands behind your back, please. You're under arrest.\"\n\"What?\" Ralph was astonished. \"What's going on?\"\n\"Buying scalped tickets is illegal in Los Angeles,\" said the undercover police officer. \"It's been illegal for 25 years. Don't worry. The police station is right outside the park. We'll have you back here right after we book you. You can pay the $150 fine with your credit card.\" The officer handcuffed Ralph.\n\"This has got to be a joke. You people have never enforced this law before,\" said Ralph.\n\"Well, we've got a new mayor and he wants us to enforce all the laws that bring in money. Come with me, please. I'll have you back here in 20 minutes. Ma'am, you can wait here for him. You might want to buy some legitimate tickets while you're waiting. Have a nice day. Oh, and enjoy the game!\"",

The wind would steer him, he said. <+===+> would he know where he was going to <+===+>? When he saw a nice landing spot, he’d <+===+> shoot holes in the balloons with his BB <+===+>, he said.

In a few days, Bo had it <+===+> figured out. He called up a balloon store <+===+> ordered 50 balloons and a few helium tanks <+===+> fill up the balloons.

Both wanted to be major league baseball players when they grew up.\nOn Thursday, baseball practice lasted for two hours after school. After practice, Travis and Paul were hungry and thirsty. Between them, they had $2.05. There was a small grocery store three blocks from the school.\n\"What can we buy for only $2?\" asked Travis.\n\"We could split a soda and a candy bar,\" replied Paul.\n\"That's going to be hard to do, since I like orange soda and you like root beer,\" said Travis.\n\"And I hate peanuts in candy bars and you love them,\" said Paul.\nAs they approached the store, they were still thinking about their problem. One solution, of course, was for one of them to pick the soda and the other to pick the candy bar. The problem with that solution would be that one of them would still be thirsty and the other would still be hungry.\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Paul. \"I've got an idea.\" They stopped, and Paul told Travis his idea.\nMr. Cobb was the store owner. He had no use for kids. They were little people with little money. His eyes narrowed as he saw the boys approaching the store.\nAfter they entered the store, Travis walked over to the big cooler that was filled with ice and sodas. Paul walked over to the candy bar section.\n\"Mr. Cobb, you don't have any orange soda,\" Travis said.\n\"Yes, I do. Just dig a little. You'll find one.\"\nTravis dug for a minute.\n\"I still can't find one.\"\n\"Are you blind? I'll be right there.\"\nMr. Cobb started digging through the ice. Paul immediately put two candy bars into his trousers' baggy pockets. He patted the pockets down a little bit.\n\"Look! Orange soda! What did I tell you?\"\n\"Thank you, sir,\" Travis said.\nAs Travis was paying for the orange soda and the root beer, Mr. Cobb looked at Paul.\n\"You're not buying anything?\"\n\"No, sir. We just wanted some sodas.\"\n\"Then why were you looking at the candy bars?\"\n\"Just to see if you got any new brands, sir.\" Mr. Cobb's narrow eyes got narrower as they moved slowly from Paul's eyes to his shirt, to his pants, and to his shoes.\n\"If I ever catch you stealing from me, I'll chop off your hands, you hear me?\" For emphasis, Mr. Cobb reached down beneath the countertop and pulled out a butcher knife, sharp and shiny.\nBoth boys were startled. They ran out of the store.\n\"Come back here. You forgot your change!\" Mr. Cobb yelled at them.",

Was he in the right aisle? He looked at the sign again. Yes, he was. He finally found the eyedrops. He went to the front of the drugstore. He stood in line to pay. Someday, he thought, shopping will be faster. Someday, he thought, I will walk into any store. I will say, \"Finder, where's the Crest toothpaste?\" A blinking light, the size of a 60‐watt bulb, will appear. I will follow the light directly to the Crest toothpaste section. I'll say thank you, and the Finder will disappear."

No, he patiently tried to explain, he just wanted to get another hour of sleep.\nBut he could not sleep anymore. Once Jolene mentioned anything about Amy, he'd better get over there quickly. Scott broke up with Amy five years ago. Now they were just friends. But, Amy still loved him. That wasn't a problem for Scott, until Jolene found out about it.

A woman nearby was smoking a cigarette. \"Excuse me,\" he said. \"Can I buy a cigarette from you for a dollar?\" He offered her a dollar bill. She gave him a cigarette. She refused his money.

The plane didn't flip over. It landed on its belly. Nobody died, but five people were injured. Everyone got out of the plane. They stood on the wings of the plane. Everyone was cold and wet. Boats rescued them all. It was the \"Miracle on the Hudson.\" Today many of the same passengers got on two boats. The two boats went to where the plane had landed.

He closed the trunk and stood there, admiring his new car. He carried his clubs to the clubhouse. He rented a pull cart and paid his greens fees. He walked out to the first tee. Nobody was on the fairway in front of him. He hit his drive and started walking up the fairway.\nThe first fairway was next to the road. He could see his car as he walked uphill. Suddenly he heard tires screeching. He heard somebody yell something. He looked up the road. A car was speeding downhill. It was going way too fast. Jerry watched in horror. Please don't hit my new car, he prayed. The driver of the speeding car lost control. The car crashed into Jerry's car. A fence separated the road from the golf course. Jerry ran over to the fence. He watched the driver get out of the car; he was laughing!\nThe driver started running down the road. Jerry climbed over the fence and ran after him. Another golfer called 911. Jerry couldn't keep up with the driver. He lost sight of him. Jerry trudged back uphill to his car. It was totaled. He looked in the other car. On the passenger floor was a bottle of whisky. He saw a marijuana cigarette in the open ashtray.\nSeveral police cars drove up to the golf course. A policeman interviewed Jerry. Jerry saw a police helicopter searching for the driver. Jerry called his wife. She arrived in her car. He put his clubs and a few things from the Honda into her car. Tow trucks towed the two wrecked cars away. Jerry and his wife went home.\nThe police found the driver a day later. They charged him with various offenses. Later, the driver went to court. He told the judge he had had a flat tire. The judge made him pay a small fine. Jerry couldn't believe it when he heard the news from a police officer.\nJerry said, \"That guy didn't have a flat tire. He was speeding! He was drunk on whisky and high on pot. He totaled two cars. If I had been in my car, I'd be dead. He left the scene of the crash. He ran from the police. He had no insurance. He lied to the judge. And nothing happens to him?!\"\nThe officer said, \"Yeah, some people have all the luck. On the other hand, if you had been in your car and he had killed you, he probably would be in jail right now. So, which do you prefer?\" 2.4, 455"

She wanted to sit down and watch some TV. They walked over to the sofa. \"Oh, you forgot to take the towels off the sofa,\" she said. \"What's this? Tell me they didn't see this.\" She pointed at a big stain on one of the colored towels. Well, that explains that, he thought."

There was too much bad news on the TV news.\nShe found a talk show to watch. It was Ellen. She liked Ellen. Ellen was a comedian. She told good jokes. She showed animals doing funny things. She gave expensive gifts to her fans occasionally. This show was a rerun, but that didn't matter to Emily.\nAll she wanted to do was relax. Watching Ellen helped a little. Emily's husband had just lost his job. Her only child had dropped out of high school. Even worse, he had left home. He told Emily he would call from time to time. But he hadn't called even once. Tomorrow would mark two weeks since he'd left home.\nShe told her husband, who was sitting in the easy chair, \"I'm worried sick. We don't know where he is. We don't know if he's even alive.\" Her husband said she shouldn't worry. He had done the same thing when he was 17. But when he found out how hard it was on the road, he returned home and finished high school.\nShe said, \"I know. You've told me that story before. Your story has a happy ending. But this is Petey's story. He could be lying dead in a ditch right now, killed by a drunk driver or stabbed by some homeless person that wanted his jacket. The police haven't been any help. I can't concentrate at work. I can't relax at home. I can't sleep at night.\" She started weeping.\nHer husband handed her a tissue. He sat next to her on the sofa and put his arm around her. He said, \"It'll be all right. Everything's going to be okay. I'm sure Petey's safe. He'll probably call tomorrow. He might even show up tomorrow. Tomorrow is two weeks, right? I was gone for only two weeks myself. Maybe like father, like son. C'mon, honey, chin up.\"\nShe snuggled up close to him and went to sleep on the sofa."

He'd had to spit out about three seeds.\nHe went back and bought another bag. Back home, he offered to peel one for his wife. She declined. The first one he ate had at least 30 seeds. His tongue got tired from all the \"seed work.\" He called the 800 number on the label. A friendly woman in Florida answered. He told her about how many seeds he'd just spit out. She apologized. She asked for his address and the cost of the bag. She said she'd send him a check for $4.99. He thanked her.\nIt's nice to deal with responsible people, he thought. He peeled another Clementine. It didn't contain a single seed. That's odd, he thought. He peeled another one. It didn't contain a single seed either. He told his wife about the seedless Clementines. She said, \"You still have time.\" He asked, \"Time for what?\" She said, \"Time to call them back, and tell them to cancel the check.\" He said, \"No. That'll just complicate things.

She looked around.\n\"Hello,\" she said loudly. \"Is anyone there?\" Nobody answered. The scratching continued. She got up from her desk. She walked over to where the sound was coming from. She looked in a trashcan. She saw a small rat. It was trying to climb up the side of the plastic trashcan, but it was making no progress. Its claws were useless on the hard plastic.\n\"How did you even get into there?\" she asked the animal. Shelly was thankful that it was only one rat, and that it was a small one. She was glad it wasn't one of the big rats she'd often seen on the subway tracks. She picked up another trashcan. She slid that trashcan into the trashcan with the rat in it. She walked downstairs carrying both trashcans. She went over to the doorman's desk.\n\"I have something for you. I think it's still alive,\" she said. She gave him the trashcans. He pulled out the top trashcan.\nHe said, \"Well, one down. How many to go? There are dozens of rats in this building. They're most active at night.\"\nShe said, \"Well, this is my first rat, and I hope it's my last. What happens if one of these things bites me?\" She went back upstairs.\nA week later, she was working in her office around lunchtime. The heat was on in the building. She smelled something. It wasn't a good smell. At first, she thought it was a coworker's body odor. Then she thought it was a coworker's lunch. Then she thought it was a dead animal. She walked over to her manager's desk.\n\"Something smells really bad. I think there's something dead in our office,\" she said.\nHe said, \"I hope it's not Mr. Evans. He's getting up there. I can't smell anything. Where is the smell coming from?\"\nShe led him over to the heating vent near the windows. He put his nose down near the vent.\n\"Phew!\" he said, as he jerked his head back. He called maintenance. A worker arrived a few minutes later. He opened the vent. He found two dead rats inside.\nShelly's manager said, \"Boy, Shelly, what a good nose you have! How about coming up to the tenth floor with me and sniffing around? Maybe we have dead rats up there too.\" 2.2, 423"

She opened a package of paper money. It wasn't real money. \"We burn the money for our ancestors,\" she said. \"Then maybe money will come to us this year.\" She took out some paper bills. She lit them. She dropped them into the pan. She lit more bills and dropped them into the pan. The living room got smoky. Finally she stopped lighting the money. It finished burning in the pan. The pan of ashes cooled. She picked it up. \"Oh!\" she said. He looked at the floor. A dark ring was burned into the wood. \"Well, I hope your ancestors send us money this year,\" he said. \"We'll need it to pay for the floor.\"  1.6"

The bottom half of the painting is white sand and brown shrubs. At the bottom right is a bit of ocean. The ocean is calm and dark blue. Small white waves break on the beach. A boat is sailing westward. The boat has four big white sails. It has a wooden hull. An old wooden house sits on the white sand. No smoke comes from the brick chimney. The roof sags in the middle. The house has a front porch. Five wooden posts support the porch roof. Clothes are hanging on a line behind the house. But there are no people anywhere. Maybe they are inside the house. Maybe they are walking along the beach. The name on the sand is Marshall Joyce."

They argued a lot. She said he was a slob. \"You're a slob!\" she said. She said he was lazy. \"You're lazy!\" she said. I moved here for this?, he wondered. He loved her. But he wasn't a dog. She yelled at him like he was a dog. \"Don't yell at me,\" he said. \"I'm not a dog.\" Whenever he tried to hug her, she pushed him away. Who needs this, he wondered. I'd rather be by myself. He decided to wait a while. Maybe things would get better. But if they didn't, he was leaving. \"If you don't change, I'm leaving you,\" she told him. Ha, he thought, we'll see who leaves who first."
